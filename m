Hey Phil,

thanks for taking the time to look at this and give feedback.

I also noted that checkpatch reported this and that it is technically a style breach,
however I kept the brace in the newline to be consistent with all the other
cdrom ioctl structs defined above this in the same file for consistency.
I have no strong feelings about this, though, so we could change this.
