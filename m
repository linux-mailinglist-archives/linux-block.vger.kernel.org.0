I agree the RCU there looks like a bit of cargo-cult and would need better
documentation if nothing else. But I think the logic behind RCU protection
inside __ioc_clear_queue() is that you can safely acquire ioc->lock and
check ICQ_DESTROYED flag - which should be set if ioc got already freed, if
not set, you hold the ioc->lock so you won the race to free the ioc.
For ioc_lookup_icq() I'm not sure what's going on there, there RCU looks
completely pointless.

I don't see that either but I think in the past an equivalent of
blk_mq_free_request() could get called during request merging while holding
all the locks (I have just recently fixed a deadlock due to this in BFQ by
postponing freeing of merged requests to the caller) and
blk_mq_free_request() will call put_io_context(). So at this point I don't
think it is needed anymore.

A worthy goal :)
