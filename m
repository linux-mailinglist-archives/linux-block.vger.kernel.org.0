Yes, the purpose of module ref-counting in nbd_alloc_config() is to force
the user to disconnect the nbd device manually before module removal.
And loop device works in the same way. If a file is attached to a loop device,
an extra module reference will be taken in loop_configure() and the removal
of loop module will fail. The only difference is that loop driver takes the
extra ref-count by ioctl, and nbd does it through netlink.

Yes, removing the module refcounting in nbd_alloc_config() and cleaning
the nbd_config in nbd_cleanup() also work, but not sure whether or not
it will break some nbd user-case which depends on the extra module
reference count. I prefer to keep the extra module refcounting considering
that loop driver does it as well, so what is your suggestion ?

Tao
