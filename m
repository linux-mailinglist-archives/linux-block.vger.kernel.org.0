Not sure. As suggested above, I try to just stick to "atomic" vs
"non-atomic" because that's ultimately the functional end result of
such a miscompilation. Although I've also had people be confused as in
"what atomic?! as in atomic RMW?!", but I don't know how to remove
that kind of confusion.

If, however, our intended model is the LKMM and e.g. a compiler breaks
a dependency-chain, then we could talk about miscompilation, because
the compiler violates our desired language semantics. Of course the
compiler writers then will say that we try to do things that are
outside any implemented language semantics the compiler is aware of,
so it's not a miscompilation again. So it all depends on which side
we're arguing for. Fun times.

Mentioning __data_racy along with data_race() could be helpful, thank
you. See comments below.

Perhaps worth mentioning, but they aren't strictly access-marking
options. In the interest of simplicity could leave it out.

See below - I'm not sure we should mention volatile. It may set the
wrong example.

"volatile" isn't something we encourage, right? In which case, I think
to avoid confusion we should not mention volatile. After all we have
this: Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst
