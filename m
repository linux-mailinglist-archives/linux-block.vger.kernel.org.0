Yeah, the dm-integrity code has always been complex and it has only
gotten moreso.  I'm struggling with it too.

This case that Daniel has seen a BUG_ON with is when there is a need to
finish a partially completed bio (as reflected by the per-bio-data's
internal accounting managed by dm-integrity).

bio_inc_remaining() is really meant to be paired with bio_chain().  They
are pretty tightly coupled these days.  We removed __bio_inc_remaining()
once we weened all (ab)users many releases ago.  Definitely don't want
an open-coded equivalent buried in an obscure dm-integrity usecase.

Could be bio_split() + generic_make_request() recursion is a way
forward -- but that'd likely require some extra work in dm-integrity.
All the additional code in dm_integrity_map_continue() makes me think I
could easily be missing something.

Mikulas, if you could look closer at this issue and see what your best
suggestion would be that'd be appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike
