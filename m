JFYI, with 6x SAS SSDs on my arm64 board, I see:

Before (5.15-rc2 baseline):
none: 445K IOPs, mq-deadline: 418K IOPs (fio read)

After:
none: 442K IOPs, mq-deadline: 407K IOPs (fio read)

So only a marginal drop there for mq-deadline.

I'll try my 12x SAS SSD setup when I get a chance. Kashyap is kindly 
also testing.

Thanks
