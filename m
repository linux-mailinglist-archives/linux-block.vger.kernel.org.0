Well, given the path isn't hot, I don't really care.  However, what I
don't want is to have to continually bat back patches from the make
work code churners trying to update this code for being the wrong
pattern.  I think at the very least it needs a comment saying why we
chose a suboptimal pattern to try to forestall this.
