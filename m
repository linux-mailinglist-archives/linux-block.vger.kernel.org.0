The third one is the race to use sysfs attributes and those routines
then derefernece th egendisk private_data.

It depends on existing userspace scripts which are used to test and
expectations set. Consider existing tests, you would know better, and
since you are the maintainer you decide.

I at least know for many other types of device drivers an rmmod is
a sledge hammer.

You decide. I just thought it would be good to highlight the effect now
rather than us considering it later.

The try stuff only resolves the deadlock. The bget() / bdput() resolves
the race to access to the gendisk private_data.

What is not the one we have atm? I *do* have a proposed generic solution
for 2/3 issues we have been disussing:

 a) deadlock on sysfs access
 b) gendisk private_data race

But so far Greg does not see enough justification for a), so we can either
show how wider this issue is (which I can do using coccinelle), or we
just open code the try_module_get() / put on each driver that needs it
for now. Either way it would resolve the issue.

As for b), given that I think even you had missed my attempt to
generialzie the bdget/bdput solution for any attribute type (did you see
my dev_type_get() and dev_type_put() proposed changes?), I don't think
this problem is yet well defined in a generic way for us to rule it out.
It is however easier to simply open code this per driver that needs it
for now given that I don't think Greg is yet convinced the deadlock is
yet a widespread issue. I however am pretty sure both races races *do*
exist outside of zram in many places.

Yes that itself prevents races against the gendisk private_data from
being invalid. Why because a bdget() would not be successful after
del_gendisk():

del_gendisk() --> invalidate_partition() --> __invalidate_device() --> invalidate_inodes()

They try_module_get() approach resolves the deadlock race, but it does
so in a lazy way. I mean lazy in that then rmmod wins over sysfs knobs.
So touching sysfs knobs won't make an rmmod fail. I think that's more
typical expected behaviour. Why? Because I find it odd that looping
forever touching sysfs attributes should prevent a module removal. But
that's a personal preference.
