Thanks everyone for the feedback thus far; I just sent out a v2 patch
based on everyone's comments
I am happy to see the discussion moving forward here and I look
forward to your continued input

Given my use case and expertise I have not looked into NMVe at the moment.
I see a possible option, i.e. rename the F_LIFETIME flag to
F_EMMC_LIFETIME, and leave everything else as-is
When someone (myself or others) wants to add NMVe support, add a F_NMVE_LIFETIME
Then T_LIFETIME could return either the existing eMMC data structures,
or the new NMVe data structures depending on which
feature flag is exposed.
The only issue here would be that you could not support both at the
same time, but I am personally not convinced that this would be a
major issue, as I imagine most implementations would be passthroughs
of what the underlying host hardware is offering, and so you
would provide NMVe info on NMVe hardware and eMMC info on eMMC hardware.
What do you think?
