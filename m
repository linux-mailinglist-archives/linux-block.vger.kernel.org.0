Thanks for double-checking.

I wanted to do it as well but wondered if we should focus on limiting
changes or doign an in-depth cleanup. I'll see if I find time for
an extra round of per-arch cleanup, I think it doesn't cost much and
is probably worth being done.

Will do in my local patch set and I'll also CC RMK and the few other
persons having touched the ARM part of the driver.

Thank you! I've also found an unlocking bug in the driver, when doing
ioctl(FDRESET), if a signal comes, we leave without unlocking. I'll
send a separate patch for this.

Regards,
Willy
