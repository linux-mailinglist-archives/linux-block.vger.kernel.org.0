My qemu's backing storage is a nullblk which makes format a no-op, but I
can try something slower if you think that will have different results.
These kinds of tests are definitely more pleasant to run under
emulation, so having the recipe to recreate there is a boon.

At the moment I'm interested in upstream, so either Linus' latest
6.1-rc, or the nvme-6.2 branch. If you can confirm these are okay (which
appears to be the case on my side), then I can definitely shift focus to
stable back-ports. But if they're not okay, then I want to straighten
that side out first.
