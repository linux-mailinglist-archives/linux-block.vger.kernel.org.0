Ok, then stop right there.  Fix that up.  Don't try to route around the
standard way of displaying log messages by creating a totally different
way of doing things.

Just use the dev_*() calls, and all will be fine.  Kernel log messages
are not "ABI" in that they have to be preserved in any specific way, so
adding a prefix to them as dev_*() does, will be fine.
