The nameless writes idea is vastly different from Zone append, and have 
little of the drawbacks of nameless writes, which makes the 
well-documented literature not apply.

My point with the above paragraph was to clarify that we are not trying 
to be difficult or opinionated, but point out that the reason we give 
you the specific feedback, is that it is the way it is in the kernel as 
today.
