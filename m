OK, I now understand what you mean. Indeed the full code is like:

bfq_insert_request()
  ...
  bfq_init_rq()
    bfq_check_ioprio_change(bic, bio);
    bfq_bic_update_cgroup(bic, bio);
      - this correctly moves bfqq of the process to appropriate blkcg
    bfqq = bfq_get_bfqq_handle_split()
    ... now associate request with bfqq ...
  __bfq_insert_request()
    new_bfqq = bfq_setup_cooperator()
    ... move request to new_bfqq ... there is no guarantee about the
    parent of new_bfqq, it may be a different cgroup if bic->stable_merge_bfqq
    predates process move, it may point to a dead cgroup or whatever.

Now I think there are several things wrong about the current code:

1) A process can submit IO for multiple cgroups (if e.g. fsync() is doing
writeback of pages created in the page cache by a process from different
cgroup). Thus bfqq can at the same time contain IO from multiple cgroups
and reparenting of bfqq in bfq_bic_update_cgroup() is going to have
interesting side-effects on the scheduling decisions. This is going to be
difficult to fully solve - probably bfqq in bic should have as a parent
cgroup pointed to by css of the process and if we detect currently
submitted bio belongs to a different cgroup, we need to lookup & create new
bfqq with appropriate parent and queue the request there. But this is not
critical issue at this point so we can leave it for later, I just wanted to
mention this to set frame for the problems below.

2) Bfqq merging (bfq_setup_cooperator() and friends) happens in
__bfq_insert_request() rather late during request queueing. As a result we
have to redo several things when we decide to merge queues (as request is
already queued in the previous queue) and we miss to update cgroup parent.
IMHO we should reorganize the code flow so that all the queue merging &
splitting happens first, we get final bfqq out of that and we associate
request with that bfqq (including cgroup handling). This will also fix the
use-after-free issue.

3) If the process is moved to a different cgroup (or just submits bio for a
different cgroup) The bic->stable_merge_bfq may point to bfqq from a
different cgroup and thus merging them is undesirable. Solution for 1) will
also deal with this problem but until then, I think that if
bfq_bic_update_cgroup() notices a cgroup mismatch, it also clears
bic->stable_merge_bfq to avoid this problem. As a side-effect this will
also fix the use-after-free issue even without solving 2).

4) I find it fragile that we may have around bfqqs with dead cgroups as a
parent and if we mistakenly activate these bfqqs (and thus parent cgroups)
and insert them in the service tree, use-after-free problem is here. So I
think that my patch to actively reparent all bfqqs from a dying cgroup
makes sense (alternatively we could make sure service tree holds a ref for
the cgroups it contains but that seems like a more expensive and intrusive
fix) and I'd keep it as a safety measure for the future.

So my current plan is:

Implement 3) as a quick and easily backportable fix for the use-after-free
issue. Then work on 2) and submit it with 4) as cleanups & future-proofing.
Once this is done, we can think about 1) but probably we should try to
see how bad that problem is in practice and whether the solution is worth
it.

What do people think?
