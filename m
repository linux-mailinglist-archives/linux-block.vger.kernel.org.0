I will drop the changes from this patch that send requeued dispatched 
requests to the I/O scheduler instead of back to the dispatch list. It 
took me considerable effort to find all the potential causes of 
reordering. As you may have noticed I also came up with some changes 
that are not essential. I should have realized myself that this change 
is not essential.

Regarding removing zone write locking, would it be acceptable to 
implement a solution for SCSI devices before it is clear how to 
implement a solution for NVMe devices? I think a potential solution for 
SCSI devices is to send requests that should be requeued to the SCSI 
error handler instead of to the block layer requeue list. The SCSI error 
handler waits until all pending requests have timed out or have been 
sent to the error handler. The SCSI error handler can be modified such 
that requests are sorted in LBA order before being resubmitted. This 
would solve the nasty issues that would otherwise arise when requeuing 
requests if multiple write requests for the same zone are pending.

Thanks,

Bart.
