Yeah, looks the issue has to be fixed from driver side, only driver has
'struct device' info.

I did see report on warning of "cacheline tracking EEXIST, overlapping mappings
aren't supported" on USB several times, since it is often treated as same with
this one.

Or dma debug log needs to be improved by showing the warning is just a
hint.
