Sorry, I am a bit confused, please look at the following code and
blk_mq_find_and_get_req()(<-bt_tags_iter).

void blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter(struct blk_mq_tag_set *tagset,
                busy_tag_iter_fn *fn, void *priv)
{
        unsigned int flags = tagset->flags;
        int i, nr_tags;

        nr_tags = blk_mq_is_shared_tags(flags) ? 1 : tagset->nr_hw_queues;

        for (i = 0; i < nr_tags; i++) {
                if (tagset->tags && tagset->tags[i])
                        __blk_mq_all_tag_iter(tagset->tags[i], fn, priv,
                                              BT_TAG_ITER_STARTED);
        }
}

In case of shared tags, only tagset->tags[0] is iterated over, so both
5 and 10 are checked, and shared_tags->rqs[5] and shared_tags->rqs[10]
shouldn't just point to the two latest requests? How can both 0xAA &
0xBB be retrieved from shared_tags->rqs[10]?

But 67f3b2f822b7 ("blk-mq: avoid to iterate over stale request") isn't
only for shared tags.
