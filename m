Sure. But what if an application uses the drive directly ? You loose
guarantees of forward progress then. Given that an application has to
use direct IO for writes to sequential zones, this is unlikely to happen
in a "good" scenario, but it also would not be hard to write an
application that can deadlock the drive forever by simply missing one
write in a sequence of writes for a zone... That is my concern. While
f2fs would likely be OK, the delay approach is not solid enough for all
cases.
