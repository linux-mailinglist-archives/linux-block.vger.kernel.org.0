It's actually easier for me if you remove the broken tag when you
notice things like this (or use the same name for the fix tag and just
force-update it).

And then send a "oops, me bad, I updated it" with the new pull data.

The reason: when I opened this thread, I didn't notice your follow-up
at first, so I pulled the old tag, and so got the known-broken code.

And yes, I double-checked and caught it, unpulled and then re-pulled
the fixed-up tag instead.

But if the wrong tag had been just overwritten or deleted, the extra
steps wouldn't have been necessary.

Not a huge deal, it's not like it took me a lot of effort (it's more
painful if I have to fix up conflicts twice, although even that isn't
usually much of a bother since the second time I don't have to really
analyze them again).

So just a heads up for "I wish you'd done X instead".

Btw, on the subject of "I wish you had done X": this is not at all
particular to you, and a lot of people do this, but pull requests tend
to have the same pattern that we are trying to discourage in patch
descriptions.

So in Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst, we talk about this:

 "Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz"
  instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy
  to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change
  its behaviour"

because once it's then accepted into git, the whole "this patch" kind
of language doesn't really make much sense. It's much better to just
describe what the change does, than say "this change does X".

The same is actually true when I merge your pull request, and I take
the description from your email. Because the same way "This patch does
X" does not make a regular commit message any more legible, the "This
pull request does X" does not make sense in the commit message of a
merge.

So I end up editing peoples messages a lot (and I occasionally forget
or miss it).

Again, this is _not_ a huge deal, and I obviously haven't made a stink
about it, but I thought I'd mention it since I was on the subject of
"this causes me extra work".
