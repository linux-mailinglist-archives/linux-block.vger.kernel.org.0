Curiously, the former was exactly my idea. I was thinking about having a 
simple nvmet userspace driver where all the transport 'magic' was 
handled in the nvmet driver, and just the NVMe SQEs passed on to the 
userland driver. The userland driver would then send the CQEs back to 
the driver.
With that the kernel driver becomes extremely simple, and would allow 
userspace to do all the magic it wants. More to the point, one could 
implement all sorts of fancy features which are out of scope for the 
current nvmet implementation.
Which is why I've been talking about 'inverse' io_uring; the userland 
driver will have to wait for SQEs, and write CQEs back to the driver.

Cheers,

Hannes
