So far, not consider it. At least now, I just don't see the need to hold
sysfs_lock for both blk_mq_unregister_dev() & elv_unregister_queue().
Then we can fix the deadlock issue which can be triggered quite easily,
and the fix should be for -stable.

Yeah, I agree that sysfs_lock has been used too widely.

sysfs_lock is required in any .show & .store callback, and switching I/O
scheduler is done in .store(), then hctx->sched_tags is protected by sysfs_lock
too.

hctx->tags is tagset wide or host-wide, which is protected by set->tag_list_lock.
