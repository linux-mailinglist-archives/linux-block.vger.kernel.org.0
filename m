I seriously have no idea unfortunately.  It works fine for me both
on qemu and on a real WD SN720 drive on my laptop.  Just for curiosity
you could try to pad the bio structure and see if bloating it to the

The other things that comes to mind is that when Johannes removed
BIO_SEG_VALID there also were some unexplainable side effects,
I'll look into seeing if there was any similarity.
