Right, I would imagine that would need to be collected separately. But
if we can get away from the busy looping, then I don't think it's too
interesting.

Most likely, yes.

Yep, it'd be a bug somewhere else.

It's just bad behavior. Honestly most of this just looks like either a
bad implementation of the protocol as it's all based on busy looping, or
a badly designed protocol. And then the sunvdc usage of it just
proliferates that problem, rather than utilizing the tools that exist in
the block stack to take a breather rather than repeatedly hammering on
the hardware for conditions like this.

It doesn't really make sense on top of yours, as that removes the
limited looping that sunvdc would do...

Why not just test this one and see if it works? As far as I can tell,
it's been 6.5 years since this change went in, I can't imagine there's a
huge sense of urgency to fix it up that can't wait for testing a more
proper patch rather than a work-around?
