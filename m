goto are allowed, but the coding style document[1] provides some
rationale for using goto, including that "If there is no cleanup needed
then just return directly". Seems like this code used to do some stuff
in the the past, but since 8ab6bb9ee8d0 "blk-mq: cleanup
blk_mq_get_driver_tag()" it is just a return.

You can have a look at the generated code for x86, here's the
original[2] and here is the modified[3]. The only improvement at the
assembly is that we get rid of this duplicated cmp instruction:

    2736:   83 f8 ff                cmp    eax,0xffffffff
    2739:   75 4b                   jne    2786
    ...
    2786:   83 f8 ff                cmp    eax,0xffffffff
    2789:   0f 95 c0                setne  al

Thanks,
	André
