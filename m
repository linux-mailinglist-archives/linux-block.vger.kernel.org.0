man iostat
...
      %util
             Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization
             for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100% for  devices  serving  re‐
             quests  serially.  But for devices serving requests in parallel, such as RAID arrays and modern SSDs,
             this number does not reflect their performance limits.
...

As you saw, %util isn't accurate from the beginning. If you want a bit more accurate
accounting before applying 5b18b5a73760 ("block: delete part_round_stats and switch
to less precise counting"), it can be done easily by one simple bcc/bpftrace prog
with extra cost.


Thanks,
Ming
