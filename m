It should be more register-friendly, as it uses fewer variables, and I
think it's easier to see what the loop is doing, i.e. that we advance
one bio_vec per iteration: in the existing code, it takes a bit of
thinking to see that we won't spend more than one iteration within the
same bio_vec.

I don't see this as fine-tuning, rather simplifying the code. I do agree
that it's not going to make much difference for performance of the loop
itself, as the most common case I think is that we either stay in the
current bio_vec or advance by one.

The WARN_ONCE case does leave it inconsistent, though that's not
supposed to happen, so less of a pitfall there.
