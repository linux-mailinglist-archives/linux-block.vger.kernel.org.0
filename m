I understand there are more objects than blkcgs but I assume it can
eventually boil down to blkcg references, so I suggest another
alternative. (But I may easily miss the relations between BFQ objects,
so consider this only high-level opinion.)

(If G is offline, P can only be zombie, just saying. (I guess it can
still be Q's IO on behalf of G.))

IIUC, the reference to G is only held by P. If the G reference is copied
into another structure (the service tree) it should get another
reference. My naïve proposal would be css_get(). (1)

Isn't it the bfq_queue.bfq_entity that's inserted in the service tree
(not blkcg G)?
You write bfq_queue is destroyed, shouldn't that remove it from the
service tree? (2)

There can be two types of references to blkcg (transitively via
bfq_group):
a) "plain" (just a pointer stored somewhere),
b) "pinned" (marked by css_get() of the respective blkcg).

The bfq_pd_offline() callback should erase all plain references (e.g. by
reparenting) or poke the holders of pinned references to release (unpin)
them eventually (so that blkcg goes away).

I reckon it's not possible to traverse all references in the
bfq_pd_offline().

I guess this is what I wondered about in (2). (But I'm not sure this
really is proof against subsequent re-insertions into the tree.)

If (1) used css_tryget_online(), the parent (or ancestor if it happened
to be offlined too) could be the fallback.

The question here is how long would stay the offlined blkcgs around if
they were directly pinned upon the IO submission. If it's unbound, then
reparenting makes more sense.
