I agree that multiple asynchronous threads might transparently improve
userspace read/write performance with just one thread or a very few threads=
.
However, it's unclear how genuine the requirement is. On the other hand,
in such cases, userspace can always optimize read/write bandwidth, for
example, by using aio_write() or similar methods if they do care about
the read/write bandwidth.

Once the user has multiple threads (close to the number of CPU cores),
asynchronous multi-threading won't offer any benefit and will only result
in increased context switching. I guess that is caused by the fundamental
difference between zram and other real devices with hardware offloads -
that zram always relies on the CPU and operates synchronously(no
offload, no interrupt from HW to notify the completion of compression).

Qun-Wei's patch 2/2, which modifies the zram driver, contains the following
code within the zram driver:

+int schedule_bio_write(void *mem, struct bio *bio, compress_callback cb)
+{
+ ...
+
+        if (!nr_kcompressd || !current_is_kswapd())
+                 return -EBUSY;
+
+}

It's clear that Qun-Wei decided to disable asynchronous threading unless
the user is kswapd. Qun-Wei might be able to provide more insight on this
decision.

My guess is:

1. Determining the optimal number of threads is challenging due to varying
CPU topologies and software workloads. For example, if there are 8 threads
writing to zram, the default 4 threads might be slower than using all 8 thr=
eads
synchronously. For servers, we could have hundreds of CPUs.
On the other hand, if there is only one thread writing to zram, using 4 thr=
eads
might interfere with other workloads too much and cause the phone to heat u=
p
quickly.

2. kswapd is the user that truly benefits from asynchronous threads. Since
it handles asynchronous memory reclamation, speeding up its process
reduces the likelihood of entering slowpath / direct reclamation. This is
where it has the greatest potential to make a positive impact.

It seems there is still some uncertainty about why current_is_kswapd()
is necessary, so let's get input from Qun-Wei as well.

Despite all the discussions, one important point remains: zswap might
also need this asynchronous thread. For months, Yosry and Nhat have
been urging the zram and zswap teams to collaborate on those shared
requirements. Having one per-node thread for each kswapd could be the
low-hanging fruit for both zswap and zram.

Additionally, I don't see how the prototype I proposed here [1] would confl=
ict
with potential future optimizations in zram, particularly those aimed at
improving filesystem read/write performance through multiple asynchronous
threads, if that is indeed a valid requirement.

Right, but haven't we yet taken on the task of tuning multi-threaded zram?

I'm not entirely sure that the existing congestion or throttled writeback
can automatically tune itself effectively with non-offload resources. For
offload resources, the number of queues and the bandwidth remain stable,
but for CPUs, they fluctuate based on changes in system workloads.
