This is a very interesting topic and I would like to participate in the
discussion too.

The dm-clone target would also benefit from copy offload, as it heavily
employs dm-kcopyd. I have been exploring redesigning kcopyd in order to
achieve increased IOPS in dm-clone and dm-snapshot for small copies over
NVMe devices, but copy offload sounds even more promising, especially
for larger copies happening in the background (as is the case with
dm-clone's background hydration).

Thanks,
Nikos
