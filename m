Got it, thanks for the sharing.

So far, all in-tree .commit_rqs() implementation requires lock.

I guess it is just that there can be multiple requests available from
scheduler queue. Actually it can be so for other non-nvme drivers in
case of none, such as SCSI.

Another way is to use one per-task list(such as plug list) to hold the
requests for dispatch, then every drivers may see real .last flag, so they
may get chance for optimizing batch queuing. I will think about the
idea further and see if it is really doable.


Thanks,
Ming
