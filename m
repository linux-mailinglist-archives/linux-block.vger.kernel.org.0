I don't think this is correct.
This code is submitting the original bio, and we _want_ to keep the 
newly allocated one even though the original might have been completed 
already. If we were setting the 'parent' to the original bio upper 
layers might infer that the entire request has been completed (as the 
original bio is now the 'parent' bio), which is patently not true.

So, rather not.

Cheers,

Hannes
