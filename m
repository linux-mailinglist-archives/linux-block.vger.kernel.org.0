There are several device-mapper targets that Android can require for the
"userdata" partition -- potentially in a stack of more than one:

dm-linear: required for Dynamic System Updates
(https://developer.android.com/topic/dsu)

dm-bow: required for User Data Checkpoints on ext4
(https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/user-data-checkpoint)
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10838743/)

dm-default-key: required for metadata encryption
(https://source.android.com/security/encryption/metadata)

We're already carrying this patchset in the Android common kernels since late
last year, as it's required for inline encryption to work when any of the above
is used.  So this is something that is needed and is already being used.

Now, you don't have to "count" dm-bow and dm-default-key since they aren't
upstream; that leaves dm-linear.  But hopefully the others at least show that
architecturally, dm-linear is just the initial use case, and this patchset also
makes it easy to pass through inline crypto on any other target that can support
it (basically, anything that doesn't change the data itself as it goes through).
