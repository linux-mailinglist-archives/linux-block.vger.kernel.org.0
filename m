I was out all day yesterday, so didn't get a chance to follow up on this
one. I did notice that you pulled it, thanks for that.

My test box is currently out of commission. While that doesn't mean it
gets no testing, it does mean I'm using my laptop and qemu configs.
Neither one of those have BFQ set, which is why it was missed. While
that isn't ideal, it's not a core kernel file, or it would have never
been missed. If you look at the patches, it's also not like they weren't
reviewed, in fact they were quite heavily reviewed.

So, yes, I agree this was unfortunate, and I hate having sent something
that didn't compile for a pretty common option. That sucks.
