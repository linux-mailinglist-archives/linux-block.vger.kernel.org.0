Please don't do top reply which is hard to follow context.

No.

The current way of blk_next_bio() works just as expected, and your patch
is actually wrong. Let's see one simple example, suppose one discard request
is splitted into two bios(bio 0, and bio 1), after your patch is applied:

1) bio 0 becomes bio 1's parent, and bio 0 is submitted first

2) bio 1 is submitted finally via submit_bio_wait(), and bio 1's .bi_end_io/.bi_private
is updated to submit_bio_wait_endio()/&done, so when bio 1 is completed, there
isn't any way to know if bio 0 is completed, because the chain is cut by your patch.
