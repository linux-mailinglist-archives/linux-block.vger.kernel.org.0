19ms looks too big just for preparing one 32MB sized bio, which isn't
supposed to
take so long.  Can you investigate where the 19ms is taken just for
preparing one
32MB sized bio?

It might be iov_iter_get_pages() for handling page fault. If yes, one suggestion
is to enable THP(Transparent HugePage Support) in your application.
