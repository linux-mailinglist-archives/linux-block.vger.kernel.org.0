OK, looks VDO's chunk_sector limit is one hard constraint, even though it
is one DM device, so I guess you are talking about DM over VDO?

Another reason should be that VDO doesn't use blk_queue_split(), otherwise it
won't be a trouble, right?

Frankly speaking, if the stacking driver/device has its own hard queue limit
like normal hardware drive, the driver should be responsible for the splitting.

I just don't know this story, thanks for your clarification.

As I mentioned above, if the stacking driver has its own hard queue
limit, it should be the driver's responsibility to respect it via
blk_queue_split() or whatever.


Thanks,
