Trying mkfs.xfs there were no merges at all, which is expected as
it does perfectly sized direct I/O.

Trying mkfs.ext4 I see lots of bio merges.  But for those this patch
nothing changes at all, as we never decrement nr_phys_segments to start
with, we only every did that for request merges, and for those also
only for those on non-gappy devices due to the way the
req_gap_back_merge check was placed.
