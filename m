Thanks a lot for your reply. We only do maintain the upstream code: we
have an extra compatibility layer which allows us to compile this code
for older kernels still in use in our production and we plan
to continue to do so in the future.
The only real difference of this code to the one running in our production
right now is the name of the driver: it is still "ibnbd" instead of current rnbd
but we will switch to it for the new kernels and also for the older kernels as
soon as our internal provisioning and monitoring infrastructure is prepared.

@Jason Should I resent you the patchset with Acked-By Jens added?
