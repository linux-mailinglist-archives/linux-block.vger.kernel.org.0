The thing that tripped me is

+void dasd_path_remove_kobj(struct dasd_device *device, int chp)
+{
+	if (device->path[chp].in_sysfs) {
+		kobject_put(&device->path[chp].kobj);
+		device->path[chp].in_sysfs =3D false;
+	}
+}

As an exported function, it is not clear where this may be called from.
Given your explanation above (and some more code reading on my side),
the code looks ok in its current incarnation (but non-idiomatic).

Is there a way to check that indeed nobody re-adds a previously removed
path object due to a (future) programming error? And maybe add a
comment that you must never re-register a path? "The path is gone,
let's remove the object" looks quite tempting.
