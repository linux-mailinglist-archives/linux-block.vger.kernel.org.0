I'd be very hesitant to pick anything up that hasn't been posted and
included upstream...

I have no opinion on that, there's not even a description of why that
change makes any sense. Sorry but I'm not going to waste my time
reviewing out-of-tree code, it's just not a very useful thing to do. If
the changes get submitted upstream for review in a suitable fashion,
then they will get reviewed.

And to be frank, the changes you referenced also look pretty incomplete
and would not pass upstream review. I guess they are dead in the water
at this point, unless someone else picks them up and polishes them into
something that can be sent upstream for review.

Right, the patch I sent is against the normal upstream tree.

Sure.
