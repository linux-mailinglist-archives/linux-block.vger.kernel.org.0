Huh?  No, that's not the issue here, it's the issue of different
userspace code paths into the module at the same time that it is trying
to be unloaded.  That has nothing to do with loading the module the
first time as userspace is not touching those apis yet.

The linker has nothing to do with this, it's userspace tasks touching
code paths.
