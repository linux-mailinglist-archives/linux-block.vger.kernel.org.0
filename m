Because there was no answer, I have analyzed the device mapper in more
detail. I found out, that one can get access to the virtual and
"underlying" devices. The virtual device (mapped_device) is created and
managed by the device mapper. The mapped_device can be obtained in the
constructor of a device mapper target by calling dm_table_get_md(). The
function call needs the table of the dm_target as parameter and returns
a pointer to the mapped_device structure. The structure contains
pointers to the gendisk and the block_device of the mapped_device. The
"underlying" devices of the table can be obtained or added by calling
dm_get_device() in the constructor, too. The call returns a pointer to a
dm_dev structure. Then, the dm_dev structure contains a pointer to its
referenced block_device. Now there is direct access to the block_device
or gendisk structures. This means that one can implement the three
functionalities to support sparse container formats and implement my
file format subsystem and file format drivers as device mapper targets.
But one should take care of the direct access to the block_device and
gendisk structures in a device mapper target because sometimes there is
the risk of bypassing the device mapper framework. Please be careful and
read the comments and descriptions of the exported functions in the
device mapper framework.

Compared to the proposed loop device module integration, this approach
seems harder to achieve for me. Furthermore, the device mapper target
needs an additional user space utility to simplify the control of the
file format subsystem and drivers and help people who are afraid of the
dmsetup utility ;)

Would you accept the proposed file format subsystem and drivers
implemented as device mapper targets?
