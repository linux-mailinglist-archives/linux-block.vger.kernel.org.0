If I understand the FDP technology correctly, I can see the benefits for
file systems. :)

For example, SSDFS is based on segment concept and it has multiple
types of segments (superblock, mapping table, segment bitmap, b-tree
nodes, user data). So, at first, I can use hints to place different =
segment
types into different reclaim units. The first point is clear, I can =
place different
type of data/metadata (with different =E2=80=9Chotness=E2=80=9D) into =
different reclaim units.
Second point could be not so clear. SSDFS provides the way to define
the size of erase block. If it=E2=80=99s ZNS SSD, then mkfs tool uses =
the size of zone
that storage device exposes to mkfs tool. However, for the case of =
conventional
SSD, the size of erase block is defined by user. Technically speaking, =
this size
could be smaller or bigger that the real erase block inside of SSD. =
Also, FTL could
use a tricky mapping scheme that could combine LBAs in the way making
FS activity inefficient even by using erase block or segment concept. I =
can see
how FDP can help here. First of all, reclaim unit makes guarantee that =
erase
blocks or segments on file system side will match to erase blocks =
(reclaim units)
on SSD side. Also, I can use various sizes of logical erase blocks but =
the logical
erase blocks of the same segment type will be placed into the same =
reclaim unit.
It could guarantee the decreasing the write amplification and =
predictable reclaiming on
SSD side. The flexibility to use various logical erase block sizes =
provides
the better efficiency of file system because various workloads could =
require
different logical erase block sizes.

Technically speaking, any file system can place different types of =
metadata in
different reclaim units. However, user data is slightly more tricky =
case. Potentially,
file system logic can track =E2=80=9Chotness=E2=80=9D or frequency of =
updates of some user data
and try to direct the different types of user data in different reclaim =
units.
But, from another point of view, we have folders in file system =
namespace.
If application can place different types of data in different folders, =
then, technically
speaking, file system logic can place the content of different folders =
into different
reclaim units. But application needs to follow some =E2=80=9Cdiscipline=E2=
=80=9D to store different
types of user data (different =E2=80=9Chotness=E2=80=9D, for example) in =
different folders.

Thanks,
Slava.
