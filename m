All error paths need to be tested, yeah.

Well, looking over the code it doesn't seem like it would really
simplify the fix, unfortunately.

bcachefs has the same issue, but in bcachefs we've already got a handle
object where we can allocate and stash a holder - analagous to the
bdev_handle you're working on.

bdev_handle definitely sounds like the right direction.

Just changing the holder really seems like it should be easiest to me,
and it can get deleted after bdev_handle lands, but maybe there's a new
wrinkle I'm not aware of?

Anyways, as the error paths get tested I'm ok with this patchset - it's
fine if it's done completely by hand (you can just add a goto fail in
the appropriate place and make sure nothing explodes).

Coli - we should talk about testing at some point. I've been working on
test infrastructure; it would be great to get the bcache tests in ktest
updated, I've now got a CI we could point at those tests.

Christoph - you really gotta start CCing people properly, the patch that
broke this didn't even it linux-bcache. No bueno.
