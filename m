What about just disabling HIPRI in preadv2(2)/pwritev2(2)? Christoph 
Hellwig disabled HIPRI for libaio in

commit 154989e45fd8de9bfb52bbd6e5ea763e437e54c5 ("aio: clear 
IOCB_HIPRI"). What do you think, @Christoph?

The original patch indeed could not fix the problem. Though it could fix 
the potential deadlock,

the VFS code read(2)/write(2) is not ready by handling the returned 
-EAGAIN gracefully. Currently

read(2)/write(2) will just return -EAGAIN to user space.

What is the issue here in rq_qos_throttle()? More details?

Actually split is not only from blk_mq_submit_bio->__blk_queue_split. In 
__blkdev_direct_IO,

one input iov_iter could be split to several bios.

```

__blkdev_direct_IO:

for (;;) {
         ret = bio_iov_iter_get_pages(bio, iter);
         submit_bio(bio);
}

for (;;) {
         blk_poll()

         ...

}

```

Since  one single bio can contain at most BIO_MAX_PAGES, i.e. 256 
bio_vec in @bio->bi_io_vec,

if the @iovcnt parameter of preadv2(2)/pwritev2(2) is larger than 256, 
then one call of

preadv2(2)/pwritev2(2) can be split into several bios. These bios are 
submitted at once, and then

start sync polling in the process context.


If the number of bios split from one call of preadv2(2)/pwritev2(2) is 
larger than the queue depth,

bios from single preadv2(2)/pwritev2(2) call can exhaust the queue depth 
and thus cause deadlock.

Fortunately the maximum of @iovcnt parameter of preadv2(2)/pwritev2(2) 
is UIO_MAXIOV, i.e. 1024,

and the minimum of queue depth is BLKDEV_MIN_RQ i.e. 4. That means one 
preadv2(2)/pwritev2(2)

call can submit at most 4 bios, which will fill up the queue depth 
exactly and there's no deadlock in this

case. I'm not sure if the setting of 
UIO_MAXIOV/BIO_MAX_PAGES/BLKDEV_MIN_RQ is coincident or

deliberately tuned. At least it will not cause deadlock currently , 
though the constraint may be a little fragile.


By the way, this patch could fix the potential hang I mentioned in
