Ugg, yes.

That was actually an intentional and documented change in commit
29499ab060fe ("bcache: don't pass a stack address to
blkdev_get_by_path") because the old behavior was broken already in
addition to the changing of the block stuff underneath.  Not that I'm
arguing against your changes here, but the commit log probably needs a
bit of tweaking.
