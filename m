OK, if you are talking about non-shared tags, your issue is exactly
addressed by 67f3b2f822b7 blk-mq: avoid to iterate over stale request

Shared bitmap and shared tags should have be same thing, that means all hw queues
share same tag space.

If ->birtmap_tags is shared, only one tags should be iterated over, so
the following commit was added:

0994c64eb415 blk-mq: Fix blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() for shared tags

Not sure I understand your poing, but patch "blk-mq: avoid to iterate over stale
request" can cover both shared tags or not.
