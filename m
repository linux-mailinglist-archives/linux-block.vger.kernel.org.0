I didn't say you were. I said the concept that dm-loop is based on
is fundamentally flawed and that your benchmark setup does not
reflect real world usage of loop devices.

Nothing has changed since 2008 when this "fast file mapping" thing
was first proposed and dm-loop made it's first appearance in this
thread:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20080109085231.GE6650@kernel.dk/

Let me quote Christoph's response to Jen's proposed static mapping
for the loop device patch back in 2008:

| And the way this is done is simply broken.  It means you have to get
| rid of things like delayed or unwritten hands beforehand, it'll be
| a complete pain for COW or non-block backed filesystems.
| 
| The right way to do this is to allow direct I/O from kernel sources
| where the filesystem is in-charge of submitting the actual I/O after
| the pages are handed to it.  I think Peter Zijlstra has been looking
| into something like that for swap over nfs.

Jens also said this about dm-loop in that thread:

} Why oh why does dm always insist to reinvent everything? That's bad
} enough in itself, but on top of that most of the extra stuff ends up
} being essentially unmaintained.
} 
} If we instead improve loop, everyone wins.
} 
} Sorry to sound a bit harsh, but sometimes it doesn't hurt to think a bit
} outside your own sandbox.

You - personally - were also told directly by Jens back then that
dm-loop's approach simply does not work for filesystems that move
blocks around. i.e. it isn't a viable appraoch.

Nothing has changed - it still isn't a viable approach for loopback
devices for the same reasons it wasnt' viable in 2008.

I don't care if a downstream kernel is doing something stupid with
their kernels.

Where are the bug reports about the loop device being slow and the
analysis that indicates that it is unfixable?

The fact is that AIO+DIO through filesystems like XFS performs
generally within 1-2% of the underlying block device capabilities.
Hence if there's a problem with loop device performance, it isn't in
the backing file IO submission path.

Find out why loop device AIO+DIO is slow for the workload you are
testing and fix that. This way everyone who already uses loop
devices benefits (as Jens said in 2008), and the Android folk can
get rid of their hacky mapping setup....

-Dave.
