To be clear, we have to deal with these cases:
1) File IOs
  - User uses fcntl() only for lifetime
  - User uses per direct IO ioprio with lifetime (and maybe class/level/cdl)
  - User uses all of the above
2) Raw block device direct IOs
  - Per IO ioprio with lifetime (and maybe class/level/cdl)

(2) is easy. No real change needed beside the UFS driver bits.
But the cases for (1) need clarification about how things should work.
