Hi Jens,

Thank you very much for your reply.  As mentioned in the past, we are
committed to maintaining the code once
it's in upstream,  we tried hard to make sure the upstream version is
compatible with our in house version, so
we can switch to the upstream version in the future, the main
difference is the driver name/sysfs, we have to adapt
other in house tools which use the old "ibnbd/ibtrs" names to new
"rnbd/rtrs" names, it will take a bit time, but it will
happen for sure.

And we will follow the upstream process to push RNBD/RTRS further.

Regards!
Jack Wang
