Right, but some workload has this kind of pattern.

For example of qemu IO emulation, it often can be thought as single job,
native aio, direct io with high queue depth. IOs is originated from one VM, but
may be from multiple jobs in the VM, so bio merge may not hit much because of IO
emulation timing(virtio-scsi/blk's MQ, or IO can be interleaved from multiple
jobs via the SQ transport), but request merge can really make a difference, see
recent patch in the following link:

This way will cause regression.
