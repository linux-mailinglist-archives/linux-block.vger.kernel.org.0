When C is bigger than E, the extra range will go into condition 1) in =
next loop.
For the state machine style coding, every iteration only one piece is =
handled,
then the kind of complicated situations can be a bit simplified.

It is not easy to explain the bad block clearing logic exactly similar =
to bad
block setting logic. I'd like to have it in current shape which may =
follow the
sequence how code is implemented. If other people do have better idea to =
improve
this text block, I'd like to glad to review the change.

Clearing p[prev] is uncessary, the caller of front_clear() will decrease =
the
counter of the bad block table (bb->count), then p[prev] referenced here =
won't
be accessed anymore.

Yeah, setting hint to 0 can avoid potential unnecessary extra loop in =
prev_badblocks().
I will use it in next version, nice catch!

But how to know p[prev] is the last record in the bad block table?

Yes, it could be. But there will be a 'goto update_sectors' inside a =
quite deep
if-else code block, and later there is another goto inside this if-else =
code
block. I don't like this, this is why you see the code in current =
shapte. Only
one 'goto update_sectors' in the first level of if-else makes me much =
comfortable.

Only one 'goto update_sectors' at the above line is much better IMHO, as
I mentioned in previous reply.

'len' has to be updated before go to update_sectors, I am not able to =
move
the above code block to the location after 'update_sectors:'. Not sure =
whether
I answer your question...

Thank you for the help on code review!
