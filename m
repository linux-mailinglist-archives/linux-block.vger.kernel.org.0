That sounds like a very good analysis :)

Yes. I think the confusion is with which "inflight" we are talking about.
Between the block layer and the device, zone write plugging prevents more than 1
write per zone, so things are OK (modulo bugs...). But between the application
and the block layer, that is not well managed and as your analysis above shows,
bad things can happen. I will look into it to see if we can do something
sensible. If not, we should at least warn the user, or just outright fail using
io_uring with zoned block devices to avoid bad surprises.
