Hi Ming,

I tested and didn't see a noticeable difference with the fix when using 
the reducing tag queue depth. I got ~500K IOPs with tag queue depth of 
260, as opposed to 2M with full tag queue depth. However I was doubtful 
on this test method before. Regardless, your change and this feature 
still look proper.

@Kashyap, it would be great if you guys could test this also on that 
same setup you described previously:

Thanks,
John
