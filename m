Yes. I assumed there was already code that would always run
blk_mq_run_hw_queue() at I/O completion, but I can't find where
that happens today.

As I understand, the main difference to today is that
__blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue() can call into __blk_mq_run_hw_queue
directly rather than using the delayed work queue once we
can skip the BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING check.

Ok, I see.

Those would also cause requests to be sent to the device or the host
controller, right? Maybe we can treat them as "a non-IO request
has successfully been queued to the device" events, returning
busy from the mmc_mq_queue_rq() function and then running
the queue again when they complete?

I don't know how the dispatch_request() function fits in there,
what Hannes told me is that in ->queue_rq() you can always
look at the following requests that are already queued up
and take the next ones off the list. Looking at bd->last
tells you if there are additional requests. If there are, you can
look at the next one from blk_mq_hw_ctx (not sure how, but
should not be hard to find)

I also see that there is a commit_rqs() callback that may
go along with queue_rq(), implementing that one could make
this easier as well.

Ok, I must have misremembered which callback that is then, but I guess
there is some other place to do it.
