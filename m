It's debatable whether that was what fixed the underlying problem.  
Personally it makes sense to me that it could well have been.

There are three things here that *could* have been the resolution:

1.  firmware bug on the MPT3SAS controller that was fixed by the 
firmware upgrade.
2.  the relevant patch (imho likely).
3.  other changes from 6.4.6 to 6.4.12 (I didn't spot anything that I 
think relates).

I'm also not convinced it was the controller, as such I think it likely 
that the patch in question was what did the trick.

Kind regards,
Jaco
