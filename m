The work on btrfs is a counter argument to this statement. The initial zone
support based on regular writes was going nowhere as trying to maintain ordering
was too complex and/or too invasive. Using zone append for the data path solved
and simplified many things.

I do think that zone append has a narrower use case spectrum for applications
relying on the raw block device directly. But for file systems, it definitely is
an easier to use writing model for zoned storage.
