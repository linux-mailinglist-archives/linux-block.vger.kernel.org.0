Ah ok, that explains it, just felt like it was being ignored.

I agree, that is definitely a problem, and I've run into this internally
at FB in fact.

I don't think there's necessarily an expectation, but if we change the
scope then that might cause problems for folks. All of a sudden the
iowait looks less, for example, and that can be hard to explain.

That said, I do think the patch makes sense, obviously, since that's how
I originally did the mq accounting. But it's hard to argue with history
and expectations, and that is my worry. I don't want to apply this
patch, then have to revert the behavior a few revisions later. And then
we end up with different kernels that have different metrics, and that's
somewhat of a mess.
