I believe that the thread about to make wait_cnt not zero (and increment the
wakestate index) is precisely this interrupted thread: the backtrace shows
that it had just done its wakeups, so has not yet reached making wait_cnt
not zero; and I suppose that either its wakeups did not empty the waitqueue
completely, or another waiter got added as soon as it dropped the spinlock.

In principle yes, but in practice no.  Prior to 4acb83417cad, the swapping
load would run okayish for a few minutes, before freezing up mysteriously
(presumably due to missed wakeups).  The "ish" in "okayish" because the
system time was abnormally high, and occasionally there was an odd message
from systemd about killing its journal or something - 4acb83417cad saved
me from having to investigate that further.

Prior to 4acb83417cad, it never locked up looping on wait_cnt < 0;
after 4acb83417cad, it would lock up on wait_cnt 0 in a few seconds.

But in writing that, and remembering the abnormal systime, I begin to
suspect that it might have often been in a tight loop on wait_cnt < 0,
but the batch accounting sufficiently wrong that it always got rescued
by an unrelated wakeup (shifting wakestate index), before any lockup
ever got observed and reported.  Or something like that.

(And I'm trying to avoid making a fool of myself with the arithmetic:
how quickly would wait_cnt 0 have got decremented to positive before?)

I won't mind Jens deleting that "Fixes: 4acb83417cad" if it's unfair.

I cannot usefully comment on that, it's all rather too subtle for me.

But I did wonder if each of those !waitqueue_active()s would be better
replaced just by "false"s: we only get that far into __sbq_wake_up() if
waitqueue_active(), so the !waitqueue_active() case reflects a race:
a possible race, yes, but a race that wants precise accounting at a
few imprecise locations?
