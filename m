Oh, request merging definitely does make a difference. But the elevator
hash & merge logic I'm modifying here is used only by BFQ and MQ-DEADLINE
AFAICT. And these IO schedulers will already call blk_mq_sched_try_merge()
from their \.bio_merge handler which gets called from blk_mq_submit_bio().
So all the merging that can happen in the code I remove should have already
happened. Or am I missing something?
