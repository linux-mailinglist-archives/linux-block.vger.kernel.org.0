I think the problem is in __blkdev_direct_IO() and not related to 
request size:

                         qc = submit_bio(bio);

                         if (polled)
                                 WRITE_ONCE(iocb->ki_cookie, qc);


The first call to submit_bio() when dio->is_sync is not set won't have 
acquired a bio ref through bio_get() and so the bio/dio could be freed 
when ki_cookie is set.

With the specific io_uring test, this happens because 
blk_mq_make_request()->blk_mq_get_request() fails and so terminates the 
request.

As for the fix for polled io (!is_sync) case, I'm wondering if 
dio->multi_bio is really necessary in __blkdev_direct_IO(). Can we call 
bio_get() unconditionally after the call to bio_alloc_bioset(), set 
dio->ref = 1, and increment it for additional submit bio calls?  Would 
it make sense to do away with multi_bio?

Also, I'm not clear on how is_sync + mult_bio case is supposed to work.  
__blkdev_direct_IO() polls for *a* completion in the request's hctx and 
not *the* request completion itself, so what does that tell us for 
multi_bio + is_sync? Is the polling supposed to guarantee that all 
constituent bios for a mult_bio request have completed before return?

PS I couldn't see 256k requests being split via __blk_queue_split(), 
still not sure how that works.
