Why not?  There is clear use-case for this API, as demonstrated in the
patchset: DM can/will make use of it for the purposes of enhancing its
more unlikely bio requeuing work (that is needed to make the more
likely bio splitting scenario more efficient).

We don't _need_ this API to cure cancer for all hypothetical block
drivers.

If consumers of the API follow the rule that end sector of the
_original bio_ isn't changed then it is all fine.  It is that simple.

Stacked drivers will work just fine.  The lower layers will be
modifying their bios as needed. Because for DM those bios happen to
be clones, so there is isolation to the broader design flaw you are
trying to say is a major problem. As this patchset demonstrates.

I do concede that policing who can use an API is hard.  But if some
consumer of an API tries something that invalidates rules of the API
they get to keep the N pieces when it breaks.

Mike
