Looks my gmail inbox has problem, and I didn't see your referenced commit.
but I can see your reply just now in my redhat email box, sorry for that.

BTW, commit 6131837b1de6 ("blk-mq: count allocated but not started requests
in iostats inflight") didn't does what it claimed. blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter()
iterates over driver tags, so for real io scheduler, blk_mq_check_inflight()
basically returns count of inflight request, instead of allocated request.

Even worse, since commit 6131837b1de6 blk_mq_in_flight() behaves inconsistently
between q->elevator and !q->elevator.

Looks iostat doesn't use the 'inflight' count, so what is the userspace's
expectation on this counter?

If it counts allocated request, it is easy for userspace to observe different
statistics if someone updates nr_requests via sysfs.


Thanks,
Ming
