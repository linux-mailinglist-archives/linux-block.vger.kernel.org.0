That's not fair, do not add additional complexity to the kernel, and a
global option like this, just because your userspace configuration is
complex.

The fact that this is a global change should make it a non-starter as
that is one of the main reasons module options should never be used.

Again, we have learned from past mistakes, let's not forget them.
