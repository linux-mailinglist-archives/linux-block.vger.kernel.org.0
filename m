blkg_release() does guarantee that no new stat associated with this
blkg can be added any more, so what is the use-after-free?

Yeah, but is it one big deal? The percpu list should be flushed just in one
of blkg's release handler.

Problem is that new stat still may be added to this list after
percpu_ref_kill() returns.

To be honest, I really hate to grab/put blkg refcnt for adding/consuming
state, and this way is too fragile.
