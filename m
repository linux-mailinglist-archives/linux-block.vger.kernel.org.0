I thought you will suggest that :) Well, I'd probably allow waker-wakee
relationship if the two cgroups are in 'ancestor' - 'successor'
relationship. Not necessarily only root cgroup vs some cgroup. That being
said in my opinion it is just a poor mans band aid fixing this particular
setup. It will not fix e.g. a similar problem when those two processes are
in the same cgroup but have say different IO priorities.

The question is how we could do better. But so far I have no great idea
either.
