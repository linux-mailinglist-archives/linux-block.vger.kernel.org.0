I sent it out.  When I tested with next-20200114, the fio test ran ok 
for sync/async with 4k.  The sync test ran ok with 256k as well but I 
still hit the original use-after-free bug with 256k.

With next-20200130 however, I'm hitting the use-after-free bug even with 
4k so it is not a size related issue.

I wasn't sure how to force a multi-bio case so that hasn't been tested.

Also, a question about below code in io_complete_rw_iopoll()

         if (res != req->result)
                 req_set_fail_links(req);


req->result could be set to the size of the completed io request, is the 
check ok in that case?

In a multi-bio case, I think it would poll for the last part of it, I 
haven't changed that.  I did add a check for a valid cookie since I 
think it would loop forever in that case.
