Do you have user visible problem wrt. io polling? If yes, can you
provide more details?

If it is guaranteed that the returned cookie is from bio 1, poll is
supposed to work as expected, since bio 1 is the chained head of these
bios, and the whole fs bio can be thought as done when bio1 .end_bio
is called.

Yeah, that is why io poll can't work on DM.

Forward progress has to be provided on new splitted bio allocation which
is from same bio_set.


Thanks,
