It seems fine to revert to previous behavior when host_tagset is set. I 
didn't check the results for this recently, but for the original shared 
tagset patchset [0] I had:

none sched:		2132K IOPS					
mq-deadline sched:	2145K IOPS			

A quick audit of other SCSI HBA drivers in drivers/scsi which set 
nr_hw_queues and don't set host_tagset gives lpfc, qla2xxx, qedi 
(nr_hw_queues seems to be getting unset), storvsc_drv (host_tagset might 
be getting set), virtio_scsi, and then mpi3mr

Thanks,
John
