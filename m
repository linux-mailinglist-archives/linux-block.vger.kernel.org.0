Just take a quick look at the code, if the spawned request can't be allocated,
scsi will return BLK_STS_RESOURCE for the original scsi request which will be
retried later by blk-mq.

So if tag depth is > 1 and max allowed inflight write buffer command is limited
as 1, there shouldn't be the deadlock.

Or is it possible to reuse the original scsi request's tag for the
spawned request? Like the trick used in inserting flush request.
