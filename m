I don't know, so expose to wider audiences.

I didn't care if the barrier is smp_mb__after_atomic or smp_mb() because it
is added in slow path.

What I tried to express is that every SMP memory barrier use should be commented
clearly, especially about the pairing usage, see "SMP BARRIER PAIRING" section of
Documentation/memory-barriers.txt.

So please add comments around the new added smp_mb__after_atomic(),
something like:

/*
 * The pair of the following smp_mb__after_atomic() is smp_mb() implied in
 * test_and_set_bit_lock pair from sbitmap_get(), so that setting tag bit and
 * checking INACTIVE in blk_mq_get_tag() can be ordered, same with setting
 * INACTIVE and checking tag bit in blk_mq_hctx_notify_offline().
 */

The OPs have been ordered in this way, that is exactly purpose of the added memory
barrier.
