What is _this_ RT case? We really don't implement policy for a specific
use case. If the kernel implements a policy then it has to be generally
useful and practical.

Again. This is a specific usecase. Is this generally applicable?

Yes, this needs to be documented very clearly with that command line
parameter.

Mostly. See above.
