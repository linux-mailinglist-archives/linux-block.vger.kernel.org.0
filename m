Well.  With the the uevent supression in the current series there won't
be uevents until the capacity has been set to 0.  More importantly
anything that listens to theses kinds of uevents needs to be able to
deal with I/O errors like this.

Again, if you clear the FD expecting I/O errors is the logical consequence.
This is like saying we should work around seeing I/O errors when hot
removing a physical device.

Same I/O error story.  If you hot remove a nvme SSD you do expect
error in the file system.  This is a pretty clear action -> consequence
relation.

I really do like this patch.  And I think based on your description that
we both agree that the disk_openers check is not needed for functional
correctness as a malicious userspace can do concurrent operations even
without the openers check.  You want a protection against "I/O errors"
when the FD is cleared on a live device, and with your patch we get
that with the disk_openers check.  I'm perfectly fine with that state
for this series as it keeps the status quo.  I just think this check
that goes all the way back is actually a really bad idea that just
provides some false security.  But that isn't something we need to
discuss here and now.
