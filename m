Atomic test is still going to be better than pointless calls into
rq-qos, so that's still a win. Hence retaining it is better than simply
killing it off entirely.

I wonder if it makes sense to combine with IS_ENABLED() as well. Though
with how distros enable everything under the sun, probably not going to
be that useful.
