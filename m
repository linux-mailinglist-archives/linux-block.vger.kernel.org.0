There is another scenario, you can reproduce it by hot-plugging cpus to kvm guests via qemu monitor (I believe virsh setvcpus --live can do the same thing), for example:
(qemu) cpu-add 1
(qemu) cpu-add 2
(qemu) cpu-add 3

In such scenario, cpu 1, 2 and 3 are not visible at boot, hctx->cpumask doesn't get synced when these cpus are added.

Please advise what should I do to deal with the above situation? Thanks a lot.
