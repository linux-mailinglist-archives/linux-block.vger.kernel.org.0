Subject: Unreliable disk detection order in 5.x

I'm seeing disk detection order changing across reboots on 5.x kernels
(5.4, 5.10, 5.14), but not 4.9, 4.14, 4.19, with megaraid_sas (Dell
PERC_H700). With 13 disks and 5.14.14, the order changes almost always.

I did initially try to bisect this issue, but it seems to become more
rare in earlier kernels, and there are some non-booting problems between
4.x and 5.x.

The most common effect is swapping of sda with sdb, or two neighboring
devices in the list; for example:

# diff -u lsblk-S-5.10.0 lsblk-S-5.10.0-2

This is happening on vendor (Debian 5.10.0) and home-built kernels, and
on a variety of hosts. On all kernels, the detection printks come up in
an interesting order, but in older kernels, it always ends up with an
sd-name that is ordered by SCSI ID ascending:

Any ideas on suggestions on what I could use to track down what changed
here, or ideas on what might have influenced it?
