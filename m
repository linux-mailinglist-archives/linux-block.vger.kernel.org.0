I suggested all your ideas at the project meeting. The meeting revealed
that most of the people want to hold on the QCOW2 container format and
want to avoid the 'stacking' of other solutions.
In addition to that, FUSE should not be used due to performance reasons.

All in all, that leads to the plan to extend the existing loop device
driver to support not only raw binary files, but also the QCOW2
container format. If there exists a usable and clean solution at the
end, I will inform you and propose it for a review.

Thanks for your help.
