So:

  (1) We don't want to embed the struct in the hctx because we allocate
  so many of them that this is non-negligable to add for something we
  typically never use.

  (2) We don't want to allocate dynamically because it's potentially
  huge.

As long as we're using srcu for blocking hctx's, I think it's "pick your
poison".

Alternatively, Ming's percpu_ref patch(*) may be worth a look.
