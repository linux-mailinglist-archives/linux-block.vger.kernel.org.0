I just again grep source code and confirmed that blk_queue_rq_timeout is 
mostly called from the driver probe method (barring nbd driver which may
set q->rq_timeout using ioctl). And yes, agreed, q->rq_timeout can be
accessed using WRITE_ONCE/READ_ONCE.

Sure will add comment about this.

Yes this sounds like a good plan! 

Thank you Christoph for your review! And as you suggested, in another thread, 
I'd wait some more time for Jens and Ming, if in case they have any further 
comments about this change.

Thanks,
