Thanks for fixing this.

Given that in the general case switching tables will always likely result in
unaligned write errors, I think we should just report a ENOTSUPP error if the
user attempts to swap tables.

This is another case that does not make much sense in practice. So instead of
still allowing it knowing that it most likely will not work, we should return
ENOTSUPP here too I think.

I have never heard any complaints/bug reports from people attempting this. Which
likely means that no-one is needing/trying to do this. So as mentionned above,
we should make sure that this feature is not reported as not supported with a
ENOTSUPP error, and maybe a warning.
