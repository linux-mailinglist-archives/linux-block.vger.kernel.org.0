Thinking more about this, the answer is no, this cannot happen. The reason is
that zone write plugs are blocking BIOs, not requests. So the number of BIOs
queued waiting for execution does not matter as we are not holding tags. A
report zone for recovering from a write error in a zone may have to wait for a
tag for some time before executing, when many zones are being read/written at
the same time. But as long as requests complete and tags are freed, error
recovery report zones will eventually proceed and execute. No deadlock.
Even if the drive stops responding, we will eventually get a timeout and drive
reset which will abort all commands, so even then, we will have forward
progress with error recovery.

This is for the current upstream code.

Now, in your case, with several write requests issued per zone and said write
requests potentially waiting in the requeue or dispatch lists, then a report
zone for error recovery may indeed block forever... So with your changes, a
solution for this is needed I think.
