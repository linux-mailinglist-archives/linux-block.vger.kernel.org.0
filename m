rcu_read_lock and rcu_read_unlock has been proved as efficient enough,
and I don't think percpu_refcount is better than it, so I'd suggest to
not switch non-blocking into this way.

BTW, in case of blocking, one hctx may dispatch at most one request because there
is only single .run_work, even though when .queue_rq() is slept, that said
blk_mq_submit_bio() queues bio in sync style. This way won't be very efficient.
So percpu_refcount should be good enough for blocking code path, but may not be
well enough for non-blocking case.


Thanks,
Ming
