Just some historical information here. Some commit logs would seem
to make it seem that __GFP_HIGHMEM was added to support DAX, but it's
not the case. When DAX suport was removed from brd the __GFP_HIGHMEM
removed was removed by mistake, and later fixed through commit
f6b50160a06d4 ("brd: re-enable __GFP_HIGHMEM in brd_insert_page()").
But that doesn't tell us what the default were before.

To avoid future removals maybe we should document why we care?

See these commits:

9db5579be4bb5 ("rewrite rd")               initial commit with highmem
cb9cd2ef0bbb4 ("rd: support XIP")          forces highmem if XIP, but already set
a7a97fc9ff6c2 ("brd: rename XIP to DAX")   renames the config to DAX
26defe34e48e1 ("fix brd allocation flags") tries to fix the confusion but makes it worse

And so commit f6b50160a06d4 ("brd: re-enable __GFP_HIGHMEM in brd_insert_page()")
seems to be correct in re-adding it, adn commit cb9cd2ef0bbb4 ("rd: support XIP")
made things confusing assuming we wanted only highmem when DAX was
enabled.

So we only want highmem just because it's been there since it was first added.
That's all.
