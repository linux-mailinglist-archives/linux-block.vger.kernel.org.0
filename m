Yeah, that should work.

Same solution.

Looks reasonable.

Sounds good.

Aah, whoops, you're right, I missed that paragraph in the
documentation of rcu_access_pointer().

Ah, of course.

I would use put_page() instead of manually freeing it; I think that
should be enough? I'm not entirely sure though.

Ah, derp. Yes.
