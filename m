Hi Denis,

Here's what I did to uncover and reproduce the bug:
* Building a VM image with openSUSE-15.2
* VM image includes cloud-init which reads from a config-drive (with fallback to network) to customize the generic image on (first) boot
* Started the image with an attached floppy disk in KVM (qemu-5.x) that contained valid cloud-config (cidata) information
(-drive file=/tmp/ci-disk.17138.3Jf2/seed-17138.img,format=raw,if=floppy,id=cidata)

This worked fine until openSUSE updated libblkid to include a backport that opens cdroms and floppies with O_NONBLOCK (to avoid spurious CD tray closes on CDRoms).

History is at
https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1181018 <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1181018>

My understanding is that
* qemu reports media changed once on the attached floppy (it's a removable device after all) -- I have no idea whether or not that behavior from qemu is reasonable or not.
* old libblkid used to probe it without O_NONBLOCK, finding out that there is a medium inserted and clearing the media change flag
* a subsequent mount attempt (by cloud-init) would succeed

With new libblkid, using O_NONBLOCK, the media change was not cleared, and the mount would not succeed, DESPITE a valid floppy being attached before booting.

With the kernel update, the access would work again, despite blkkid using O_NONBLOCK.

Jiri should be able to understand this in more detail than I am -- I am no expert in handling of removable block devices ...

Let me know if you need a VM image to reproduce this issue -- I can find it in my archives and push it to some place for downloading.
