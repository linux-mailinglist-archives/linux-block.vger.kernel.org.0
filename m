Yes.  Things like the admin queue in nvme are under full control of
the driver.  While the "disk" queues just get I/O from the file system
and thus need to be cut off.

It isn't.  We just stop submitting to it.

The driver is a bit of a mess indeed, but the disk and queue will be
non-NULL if ->probe returns successfully so this is fine.  It is more
that some of the checks are not required.

Yes, this driver will need further work.
