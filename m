I agree it's a mess, probably buggy and could use a cleanup with a
free_disk method. But I'm not sure the all_mdevs lifetime issues are the
problem here. If the entry in all_mdevs outlasts the disk, then
md_alloc() will just fail earlier. Many test scripts rely on the fact
that you can stop an mddev and recreate it immediately after. We need
some way of ensuring any deleted disks are fully deleted before trying
to make a new mddev, in case the new one has the same name as one being
deleted.

The md code deletes the disk in md_delayed_delete(), a work queue item
on md_misc_wq. That queue is flushed first in md_misc_wq, but somehow,
some of the disk is still not fully deleted by the time
flush_workqueue() returns. I'm not sure why that would be.
