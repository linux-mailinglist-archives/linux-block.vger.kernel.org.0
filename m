The current documentation is a little weird, as it doesn't clearly
explain which function to use, and also has the guts of the information
on generic_make_request, which is the internal interface for stacking
drivers.

Fix this up by properly documenting submit_bio, and only documenting
the differences and the use case for generic_make_request.
