OK, pqi_alloc_io_request() does the real tag allocation, which looks a
very bad implementation, cause the real tags can be used up easily.

In my machine, there are 32 queues(32 cpu cores), each queue has 1013
tags, so there can be 32*1013 requests coming from block layer, meantime
smartpqi can only handles 1013 requests. I guess it isn't hard to
trigger softlock by running heavy/concurrent smartpqi IO.

That is only true for shared tags.
