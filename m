Before any copy offloading code is merged in the upstream kernel, a plan
should be presented for how this partial implementation will evolve into
a generic solution. As Hannes already pointed out, support for
copying between block devices is missing. SCSI support is missing.
Device mapper support is missing. What is the plan for evolving this
patch series into a generic solution? Is it even possible to evolve this
patch series into a generic solution?

Thanks,

Bart.
