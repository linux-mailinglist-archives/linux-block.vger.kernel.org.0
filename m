The SRCU readers are the I/O dispatch, which will have quite similar
runtimes for the different queues.

All the different request_queues in a tag_set are for the same device.
There might be some corner cases like storare arrays where they have
different latencies.  But we're not even waiting for the I/O completion
here, this just protects the submission.

I think this was very helpful, and at least to be moving the srcu_struct
to the tag_set sounds like a good idea to explore.

Ming, anything I might have missed?
