Because Append is the way to go and we've moved the Linux zoned block
I/O stack to required it, as should have been obvious to anyone
following linux-block in the last few months.  I also have to say I'm
really tired of the stupid politics tha your company started in the
NVMe working group, and will say that these do not matter for Linux
development at all.  If you think it is worthwhile to support devices
without Zone Append you can contribute support for them on top of this
series by porting the SCSI Zone Append Emulation code to NVMe.

And I'm not even going to read the rest of this thread as I'm on a
vacation that I badly needed because of the Samsung TWG bullshit.
