I think that the results I shared are sufficient because these show the
worst possible performance impact of fair tag sharing (two active
logical units and much more activity on one logical unit than on the
other).

Most SATA devices are hard disks. Hard disk IOPS are constrained by the
speed with which the head of a hard disk can move. That speed hasn't
changed much during the past 40 years. I'm not sure that hard disks are
impacted as much as SSD devices by fair tag sharing.

Any algorithm that is more complicated than what I posted probably would
have a negative performance impact on storage devices that use NAND
technology, e.g. UFS devices. So I prefer to proceed with this patch
series and solve any issues with ATA devices separately. Once this patch
series has been merged, it could be used as a basis for a solution for
ATA devices. A solution for ATA devices does not have to be implemented
in the block layer core - it could e.g. be implemented in the ATA subsystem.

Thanks,

Bart.
