Hi Hannes,

In theory, yes. Just the 'shared' tag should be adequate.

A problem I see with this approach is that we lose the identity of which 
tags are allocated for each hctx. As an example for this, consider 
blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter(), which iterates the bits for each hctx. 
Now, if you're just using shared tags only, that wouldn't work.

Consider blk_mq_can_queue() as another example - this tells us if a hctx 
has any bits unset, while with only using shared tags it would tell if 
any bits unset over all queues, and this change in semantics could break 
things. At a glance, function __blk_mq_tag_idle() looks problematic also.

And this is where it becomes messy to implement.

Same here...

Yeah, understood. That's just a trade-off I saw.

Thanks,
