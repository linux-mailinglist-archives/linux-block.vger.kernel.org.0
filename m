device mapper doesn't call blk_mq_stop_hw_queue or blk_mq_stop_hw_queues.

blk-mq won't call blk_mq_stop_hw_queue or blk_mq_stop_hw_queues for
dm-rq's queue too, so dm-rq's hw queue won't be stopped.

BTW blk_mq_stop_hw_queue or blk_mq_stop_hw_queues are supposed to be
used for throttling queue.

blk_mq_queue_stopped isn't necessary because dm-rq's hw queue won't be
stopped by anyone, meantime replacing it with blk_queue_quiesced() is wrong.

If two code paths are calling dm_stop_queue() at the same time, one path may
return immediately and it is wrong, sine synchronize_rcu() from another path
may not be done.

This patch isn't a fix, and it shouldn't be related with rhel8's issue.
