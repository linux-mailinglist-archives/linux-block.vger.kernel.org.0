Oh I see.  In that case I agree, although I believe this is a
root-only API and root has a lot of ways to crash the kernel, but sure
it could be fixed to restrict sockets to one of:

 - AF_LOCAL or AF_UNIX
 - AF_INET or AF_INET6
 - AF_INET*_SDP (? no idea what this is, but it's used by nbd-client)

Here are some ways NBD is used in real code:

libnbd$ git grep AF_

tests/web-server.c:  listen_sock = socket (AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM|SOCK_CLOEXEC, 0);

qemu-nbd is a bit hard to grep like this, but it only supports
Unix domain sockets or TCP/IP.
