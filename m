So, unless we move update_io_ticks() to blk_mq_start_request(),
blk_account_io_start() is always we start accouting from, no matter we
use percpu counter or blk_mq_in_driver_rw(), the inflight ios should
be 0 for the first io.

Yes, for now I prefer the current defination, let iostat start
everything from blk_account_io_start.

However, I'm fine if we decide to move update_io_ticks to
blk_mq_start_request(). One concern is that does the overhead of req
walking per jiffies acceptable?

I never do this before, however, I believe there is a way :) I can dig
deeper after we are in aggrement.
