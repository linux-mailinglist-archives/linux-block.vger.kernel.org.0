I'd think it'd be an improvement, yes.

q_usage_counter currently there, and the two will always be taken
together, and there are several other stuff that we can remove from
that cacheline without hurting performance for anything.

And when q_usage_counter is moved to the first cacheline, then I'd
expect that the dispatch_counter also moves to the front (maybe not
the first if it is on the expense of other hot members, but definitely
it should be treated as a hot member).

Anyways, I think that for now we should place them together.

You have a blktest for this? If not, I strongly suggest that one is
added to validate the change also moving forward.
