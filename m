ok

I definitely agree with this (As with other similar notes)
It's just my habit of naming functions by struct name.

After discussion, I plan to start by adding a pointer to the PI data 
in SQE struct.
This struct now has some padding that can be used for this.
Size of PI data can be determined according to integrity profile of
device and size of normal data.

Also, as recommended, the new version will use opcodes instead of the flag.

Thanks everyone for the detailed feedback. It's important for me.
I will try to correct all the issue's in the next version.

But some later )
