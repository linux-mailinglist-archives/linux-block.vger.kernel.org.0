They are 3 separate different problems. Related, but different.
At this point I think it would be difficult to resolve all 3
with one solution without creating side issues, but hey,
I'm curious if you find a solution that does not create other
issues.

If the idea then is to busy out rmmod if a sysfs attribute is being
read, that could then mean rmmod can sometimes never complete. Hogging
up / busying out sysfs attributes means the module cannto be removed.
Which is why the *try_module_get()* I think is much more suitable, as
it will always fails if we're already going down.

Right.. well the syfs attribute races uncovered here actually do
apply to any block driver as well. And which is why I was aiming
for something generic if possible.

I am not sure if you missed the last hunks of the generic solution,
but that would resolve the issue you noted. Here is the same approach
but in a non-generic solution, specific to just one attribute so far
and to zram:
