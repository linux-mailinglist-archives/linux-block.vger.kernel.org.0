That's an interesting question. I suppose reversing the order in this case
could be suprising e.g. for shingled storage. I don't think it matters that
much for normal rotational storage as there you presumably run with at
least some IO scheduler (we were using mq-deadline in our testing).

Avoiding the reversal will require small changes to plug handling (so that
we append the plug list) but it shouldn't be too bad. Still I'd do it in a
separate patch.
