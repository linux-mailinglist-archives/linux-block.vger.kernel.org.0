As mentioned by Ming fixing the lockdep reports is a bit different
from adding it first.  But I'll chime in for your proposal to fix
the report anyway.

I think requiring the queue to be frozen before we start the queue
limits update is reasonable in general, but a major pain for
sd_revalidate_disk, and unfortunately I don't think your proposed patch
works there as it doesn't protect against concurrent updates from
say sysfs, and also doesn't scale to adding new limits.

One option to deal with this would be to add an update sequence to
the queue_limits.  sd_revalidate_disk would sample it where it
currently starts the update, then drop the lock and query the
device, then takes the limits lock again, checks for the sequence.
If it matches it commits the update, else it retries.
