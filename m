That's a pretty handwavy explanation and does not give any reason why
this needs to be a smp function call and cannot be solved otherwise,
e.g. by delegating this to a work queue.

And takes spinlocks along the way.... See:

  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/locktypes.html

for a full explanation why this can't work on RT. And that's the same
reason why the smp function call will fall apart on a RT enabled kernel.
