But we can't write Linux software just for UFS.  We have no sensible
ordering guarantee anywhere else.

We'll still need REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND as the actual file system fast path
interface.  For a low-end device like UFS the sd.c emulation might be
able to take advantage of the above separate queue as an implementation
detail.
