Hi, Jan

The problem can still be reporduced...

Do you implement this in patch 4? If so, I don't understand how you
chieve this.

For example: 3 bfqqs were merged:
q1->q2->q3

If __bfq_bic_change_cgroup() is called with q2, the problem can be
fixed. However, if __bfq_bic_change_cgroup() is called with q3, can
the problem be fixed?

Thanks,
Kuai
