Yeah, I think it is more flexible or usable to allow userspace to
operate on data directly as one generic solution, such as, implement one disk
to read/write on qcow2 image, or read from/write to network by parsing
protocol, or whatever.

The topic has been discussed for a bit long, and looks people are still
interested in it, so I prefer to send out patches on linux-block if no
one objects. Then we can still discuss further when reviewing patches.

Thanks,
