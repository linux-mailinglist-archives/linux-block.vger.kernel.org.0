In case of EH, no queued requests can be completed, however driver still
needs to stop queue and reset hardware, then how can you use freeze to stop
queue? See nvme_dev_disable().

Freeze can stop to allocate new request and drain all queued requests, but
it can't prevent IO from being queued to LLD. On the contrary,
blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait() requires LLD to handle IO for moving on,
otherwise it will wait forever.
