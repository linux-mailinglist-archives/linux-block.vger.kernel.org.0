We last spoke about error injection prospects with eBPF at last year's LSFMM,
and I had explained the lay of the land of pros cons, and the last incarnation
I had tried was the one with the least amount of code affected upstream, but
that was still not a viable accepted approach as we still had to sprinkle a
few branches here and there. And so curious if things have changed.

An alternative that comes to mind recently is to do use something like
ldflags-y += --wrap=upstream_call as the CXL folks do with tools/testing/cxl/Kbuild
however I'm in no way shape or form a fan of what how they did that without proper
kconfig semantics -- that has already proven to easily crash. One *can* do this
with proper Kconfig semantics.

The only downfall to this would be that we'd have live with a copy of
the routine we want elsewhere say block/alt/foo.c to debug with the deltas we
want spinkled onto it. So we'd have to then try to keep both in sync and
that seems like another pain in the ass.

Either way, consider me interested in beating the horse on error injection.
