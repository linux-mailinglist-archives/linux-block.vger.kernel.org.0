I'm going to look at actually stopping the queue (using one of these
interfaces).  I didn't realize I wasn't actually stopping the queue.
The intent was to do so.

In speaking with Jens yesterday about freeze vs stop: it is clear that
dm-rq needs to still be able to allocate new requests, but _not_ call
the queue_rq to issue the requests, while "stopped" (due to dm-mpath
potentially deferring retries of failed requests because of path failure
while quiescing the queue during DM device suspend).  But that freezing
the queue goes too far because it won't allow such request allocation.

I realize that now.  I've changed the patch header to be a bit clearer
and staged it for 5.9, see:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-5.9&id=06e788ed59e0095b679bdce9e39c1a251032ae62
