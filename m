Yes that's possible and so I audited all sysfs attributes which are 
currently protected using q->sysfs_lock and I found some interesting
facts. Please find below:

1. io_poll:
   Write to this attribute is ignored. So, we don't need q->sysfs_lock.

2. io_poll_delay:
   Write to this attribute is NOP, so we don't need q->sysfs_lock.

3. io_timeout:
   Write to this attribute updates q->rq_timeout and read of this attribute
   returns the value stored in q->rq_timeout Moreover, the q->rq_timeout is
   set only once when we init the queue (under blk_mq_init_allocated_queue())
   even before disk is added. So that means that we may not need to protect
   it with q->sysfs_lock.

4. nomerges:
   Write to this attribute file updates two q->flags : QUEUE_FLAG_NOMERGES 
   and QUEUE_FLAG_NOXMERGES. These flags are accessed during bio-merge which
   anyways doesn't run with q->sysfs_lock held. Moreover, the q->flags are 
   updated/accessed with bitops which are atomic. So, I believe, protecting
   it with q->sysfs_lock is not necessary.

5. nr_requests:
   Write to this attribute updates the tag sets and this could potentially
   race with __blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues(). So I think we should really 
   protect it with q->tag_set->tag_list_lock instead of q->sysfs_lock.

6. read_ahead_kb:
   Write to this attribute file updates disk->bdi->ra_pages. The disk->bdi->
   ra_pages is also updated under queue_limits_commit_update() which runs 
   holding q->limits_lock; so I think this attribute file should be protected
   with q->limits_lock and protecting it with q->sysfs_lock is not necessary. 
   Maybe we should move it under the same sets of attribute files which today
   runs with q->limits_lock held.

7. rq_affinity:
   Write to this attribute file makes atomic updates to q->flags: QUEUE_FLAG_SAME_COMP
   and QUEUE_FLAG_SAME_FORCE. These flags are also accessed from blk_mq_complete_need_ipi()
   using test_bit macro. As read/write to q->flags uses bitops which are atomic, 
   protecting it with q->stsys_lock is not necessary.

8. scheduler:
   Write to this attribute actually updates q->elevator and the elevator change/switch 
   code expects that the q->sysfs_lock is held while we update the iosched to protect 
   against the simultaneous __blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues update. So yes, this field needs 
   q->sysfs_lock protection.

   However if we're thinking of protecting sched change/update using q->tag_sets->
   tag_list_lock (as discussed in another thread), then we may use q->tag_set->
   tag_list_lock instead of q->sysfs_lock here while reading/writing to this attribute
   file.

9. wbt_lat_usec:
   Write to this attribute file updates the various wbt limits and state. This may race 
   with blk_mq_exit_sched() or blk_register_queue(). The wbt updates through the 
   blk_mq_exit_sched() and blk_register_queue() is currently protected with q->sysfs_lock
   and so yes, we need to protect this attribute with q->sysfs_lock.

   However, as mentioned above, if we're thinking of protecting elevator change/update
   using q->sets->tag_list_lock then we may use q->tag_set->tag_list_lock intstead of
   q->sysfs_lock while reading/writing to this attribute file.

So yes, you've rightly guessed few of the above attributes are not well protected and few
still may require sysfs_lock protection. 

From the above list, I see that the "read_ahead_kb" should be protected with q->limits_lock.

The "nr_requests" should be protected with q->tag_set->tag_list_lock instead of q->sysfs_lock.

The "scheduler" and "wbt_lat_usec" require protection using either q->sysfs_lock or 
q->tag_set->tag_list_lock. 

The rest of attributes seems don't require protection from q->sysfs_lock or any other lock and 
those could be well protected with the sysfs/kernfs internal lock.

Thanks,
--Nilay
