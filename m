Or any kind of coherent architecture for PI..

Yeah.  NVMe actually kinda supports this, but for zone append only as we
need that for PI with zone append.   But it is limited to remapping from
a starting reftag that is the zone start address, so it's not quite as
flexibble.  Search for the PIREMAP bit in the ZNS spec.

I guess you'd do it by treating type1 PI as actual type1 PI, that is
the ILBRT is derived from the LBA.  But I'd need to think more about
it, and without a clear customer use case it's probably not going to
happen in NVMe.
