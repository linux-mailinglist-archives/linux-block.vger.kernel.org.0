If nbd has exclusive owner, it shouldn't be reconfigured, which
can be respected in kernel side only, see loop_configure().

Not all application can provide NBD_ATTR_BACKEND_IDENTIFIER, so
claiming in nbd_genl_reconfigure() is still needed, IMO.

Your patch looks fine, but only new application can benefit from it, and
we still need to avoid reconfigure if the disk is opened exclusively for
old applications. Anyway:
