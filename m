Hi Mikulas,

Thank you for your answer and suggestions.

I forgot to mention that all the partitions we are updating are
read-only, and can only be modified by snapshot-merge. This allows us to
establish a direct relation between the required COW device size and the
operations performed by the update (i.e. the number of chunks that are
going to be modified).

This is an approach we evaluated, but the main reason why we decided for
the solution of updating the snapshot and then merging it to the base
device is that we want to be sure that the update was successful before
permanently change to the base device. For example, if for some reason
the update is interrupted, it would be more difficult to roll-back or
restore the update. Additionally, if the update wants to resize the
partitions, this operation could not be done until reboot.

Here follows a just generated warning coming from a Pixel 4 kernel (4.14):

[ 3093.443808] device-mapper: table: 253:16: adding target device dm-15
caused an alignment inconsistency: physical_block_size=4096,
logical_block_size=4096, alignment_offset=61440, start=0

Does this contain all the info you asked for?

I started investigating this issue, but since we didn't notice any
performance degradation, I prioritized other things. I'll be hopefully
able to get back to this warning in the next months.
Please let me know if I can help you with that or if you need additional
information.
