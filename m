Looks to be mounted, at least I've got a /sys/kernel/debug/block/ folder 
on the relevant server.

Definitely can do, I'm not sure how to interpret the data in this - is 
there anything specific you're looking for?  Would love to not just pass 
the information on but also learn from this.

Generally the lockup rate seem to be about once a week currently so I 
expect (on average) to see this pop again some time over the weekend.

Kind regards,
Jaco
