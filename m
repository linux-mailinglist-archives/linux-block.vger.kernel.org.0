Thanks Yi for allowing me to access the system that can reproduce the 
bug. I found out that the panic problem is fixed by moving the rstat 
flushing before the destruction of blkgs in blkcg_destroy_blkgs(). I 
will post another patch later to fix that bug. However, I want to spend 
a bit more time to see if I can figure out what cause the panic in the 
first place.

Cheers,
Longman
