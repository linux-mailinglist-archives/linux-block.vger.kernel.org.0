The sd driver does have zone append emulation using regular writes. The
emulation relies on zone write locking to avoid issues with adapters that do not
have strong ordering guarantees, but that could be adapted to be removed for UFS
devices with write ordering guarantees. This solution would greatly simplify
your series since zone append requests are not subject to zone write locking at
the block layer. So no changes would be needed at that layer.

However, that implies that your preferred use case (f2fs) must be adapted to use
zone append instead of regular writes. That in itself may be a bigger-ish
change, but in the long run, likely a better one I think as that would be
compatible with NVMe ZNS and also future UFS standards defining a zone append
command.
