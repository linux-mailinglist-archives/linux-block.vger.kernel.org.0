I was talking about the internal layout of io_uring.
It sets up submission and completion rings, writes the command & data
into the submission rings, and waits for the corresponding completion
to show up on the completion rings.

A userspace block driver would need the inverse; waiting for submissions
to show up in the submission rings, and writing completions into the 
completion ring.

recvmsg feels awkward here as one would need to write a recvmsg op into 
the submission ring, get the completion, handle the I/O, write a sendmsg 
op, wait for the completion.
IE we would double the number of operations.

Sure it's doable, and admittedly doesn't need (much) modifications for 
io_uring. But still feels like a waste, and we certainly can't reach max 
performance with that setup.

Cheers,

Hannes
