This seems unnecessarily pessimistic, as the length of each bio_vec will still
be aligned to logical_block_size.  virt_boundary_mask only causes splits between
bio_vec's, not within a bio_vec.

I think we want something like:

	/*
	 * If the queue doesn't support SG gaps, then a bio may have to be split
	 * between any two bio_vecs.  Since the size of each bio_vec is only
	 * guaranteed to be a multiple of logical_block_size, logical_block_size
	 * is also the maximum crypto data unit size that can be supported in
	 * this case, as bios must not be split in the middle of a data unit.
	 */
	if (limits->virt_boundary_mask)
		largest_dus = queue_logical_block_size(q);

I think the same applies here.  As I understand it, chunk_sectors has to be a
multiple of logical_block_size.  Here's what I'm thinking:

	/*
	 * Similarly, if chunk_sectors is set and a bio is submitted that
	 * crosses a chunk boundary, then that bio may have to be split at a
	 * boundary that is only logical_block_size aligned.  So that limits the
	 * crypto data unit size to logical_block_size as well.
	 */
	if (limits->chunk_sectors)
		largest_dus = queue_logical_block_size(q);

Although, that also raises the question of whether we should require that
'bi_sector' be crypto_data_size aligned for inline encryption to be used.  Then
I think we could remove the above limitation.

I suppose the main concern with that is that if someone was to e.g. create a
filesystem on a partition which starts at a location that isn't 4K aligned, they
wouldn't be able to use inline encryption on that filesystem...  I'm not sure
how much of a problem that would be in practice.

And similarly here too.  As far as I can tell, the minimum size of a segment is
logical_block_size, which is not necessarily SECTOR_SIZE.

We can also make use of rounddown_pow_of_two() here.

Here is what I'm thinking:

	/*
	 * Each bio_vec can be as small as logical_block_size.  Therefore the
	 * crypto data unit size can't be greater than 'max_segments *
	 * logical_block_size', as otherwise in the worst case there would be no
	 * way to process the first data unit without exceeding max_segments.
	 */
	largest_dus = min(largest_dus,
			  rounddown_pow_of_two(limits->max_segments) *
			  queue_logical_block_size(q));

The disk name should go at the beginning of the log message.

The behavior of this function is a bit odd.  If no crypto capabilities can be
registered, it returns false, but it may or may not modify @ksm.  It should
probably leave @ksm unmodified in that case (which we could do by turning
blk_ksm_restrict_dus_to_queue_limits() into something that just calculates the
largest supported data unit size, and making blk_ksm_register() do the rest).
