Hello Gabriel,

CC linux-block and hope you don't mind, :-)

I think that is open source, then we can put efforts together to make things
better.

Yeah, that is true since NBD has extra socket communication cost which
can't be efficient as io_uring.

I have added the 1st fix and 3rd patch into my tree:

https://github.com/ming1/linux/commits/v5.17-ubd-dev

The added check in 2nd patch is done lockless, which may not be reliable
enough, so I didn't add it. Also adding device is in slow path, and no
necessary to improve in that code path.

I also cleaned up ubd driver a bit: debug code cleanup, remove zero copy
code, remove command of UBD_IO_GET_DATA and always make ubd driver
builtin.

ubdsrv part has been cleaned up too:

https://github.com/ming1/ubdsrv

OK, please post them on linux-block so that more eyes can look at the
code, meantime the ubdsrv side needs to handle MQ too.

Sooner or later, the single ubdsrv task may be saturated by copying data and
io_uring command communication only, which can be shown by running io on
ubd-null target. In my lattop, the ubdsrv cpu utilization is close to
90% when IOPS is > 500K. So MQ may help some fast backing cases.


Thanks,
Ming
