I'm open to something other than "arch_" if that causes confusion.
Maybe "plat_"?

Agreed, and that's why an architecture or platform can override the
functions. The first parameter also allows for further distinction of
how the data could be interpreted, including in multiple ways as you
suggest.

I wanted to allow for different types of persistent storage. For
instance you could have a platform that used a NAND deice for permanent
storage that could still use the API as proposed.

I did look at some of the other ways of dynamically registering
functions but most of the exisiting examples are centered around a
specific device entity which is not the case here. The functionailty is
pretty simple so I was hoping to keep the API simple as well.

The sys_off_handler functions certainly provide a good way of
registering for asynchronous notifications but for this purpose we need
synchronous functions that possibly return data. Many of the pci
functions end up in platform specific code but they use information
from struct pci_dev to route the call to the appropriate place.

Those calls are just using the API to read/write named variables that
happen to be keys in this case. I was envisioning that there may be
uses other than SED for persistent key/values.

The keyring folks were on the original SED patchset review and I did
incorporate a good comment involving use of keyrings. I will copy them
again (as well as EFI folks) for the next update.
