Was going to ask if this driver was used by anyone, since it's taken 3
years for the breakage to be spotted... In all fairness, it was pretty
horribly broken before the change too (like waiting in request_fn, under
a lock).

So I'm curious, are you actively using it, or was it just an exercise in
curiosity?

'last' is set if it's the last of a sequence of ->queue_rq() calls. If
you just do sync IO, then last is always set, as there is no sequence.
It's not hard to generate sequences, but on a floppy with basically no
queue depth the most you'd ever get is 2. You could try and set:

/sys/block/<dev>/queue/max_sectors_kb

to 4 for example, and then do something that generates a larger than 4k
write or read. Ideally that should give you more than 1.
