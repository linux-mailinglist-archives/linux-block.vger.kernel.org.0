Command A doesn't get budget, and A is still in sw/scheduler queue
because we try to acquire budget before dequeuing request from sw/scheduler queue,
see __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() and blk_mq_do_dispatch_ctx().

Not consider direct issue, because the hw queue will be run explicitly
when not getting budget, see __blk_mq_try_issue_directly.

Not consider command A being added to hctx->dispatch too, because blk-mq will
re-run the queue, see blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list().

Right.

Then you didn't answer my question about where A is, did you?

Why does command-A become in sw/queue now?

No.
