Priority CGroups can mess things up I think. If you have 2 processes belonging
to different CGs with different priorities and:
1) The processes do raw block device accesses and write to the same zone,
synchronized to get the WP correctly
2) The processes are writing different files and the FS decides to place the
block for the files in the same zone

Case (1) is clearly "the user is doing very stupid things" and for that case,
the user definitely deserve seeing his writes failing. But case (2) is perfectly
legit I think. That is the one that needs to be addressed. The choices I see
are: every file system supporting zone writes need to be priority CG aware when
writing files, or we ignore priority CG when writing.

The latter is I think better than the former as CGs can change without the FS
being aware (as far as I know), and such support would need to be implemented
for all FSes that support zone writing using regular writes (f2fs and zonefs).
