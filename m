Your cmp_func is the problem.  sort() in the Linux kernel, like
qsort() in the C library, has never been stable, meaning that if
cmp_func() returns 0, there is no guarantee what order *l and *r
will end up in.  Minor changes to the implementation can change the
result.  You're sorting on the cpus field, which is all 8, so your
cmp_func is saying "I don't care what order the results appear in".

(A web search on "stable sort" will produce decades of discussion
on the subject, but basically an unstable sort has numerous
implementation advantages, and problems can usually be solved by
adjusting the comparison function.)

If you want to sort by ->id if ->cpus is the same, then change the
cmp_func to say so:

static int cmp_func(const void *l, const void *r)
{
    const struct ex_s *ln = l;
    const struct ex_s *rn = r;

    if (ln->cpus != rn->cpus)
	return ln->cpus - rn->cpus;
    else
	return ln->id - rn->id;
}
(This simple subtract-based compare depends on the fact that "cpus"
and "id" are both guaranteed to fit into 31 bits.  If there's any chance
The true difference could exceed INT_MAX, you need to get a bit fancier.)
