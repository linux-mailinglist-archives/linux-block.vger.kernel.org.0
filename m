Ok, I will add the following comment in the v3 patch.

Considering that the bfqq may be in race, we should firstly check whether bfqq is in service
before doing something on it. If the bfqq in race is not in service, it means the bfqq has
been expired through __bfq_bfqq_expire func, and wait_request flags has been cleared in
__bfq_bfqd_reset_in_service func.
