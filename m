Yes.

I'm rather torn.  I think the model of the zero capacity block device
is a really, really bad one and we should haver never added it.  That
being said, for a ZNS namespace that does not support Zone Append I
can think of a model that actually makes sense:  expose it as a read-only
block device, as we can actually read from it perfectly fine, and that
would also allow ioctl access.
