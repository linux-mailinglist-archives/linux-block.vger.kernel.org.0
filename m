I sure was not aware of it, thank you for pointing it out.

I did the following below and when the swraid is rebuilding, I'm still
getting terrible overall throughput:
newmagic:~# hdparm -t /dev/md2
/dev/md2:
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(identify) failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
  Timing buffered disk reads:   2 MB in  5.76 seconds = 355.42 kB/sec

I think things hang a bit less, which I suppose it good, but the system is
still unusable overall.

 
newmagic:~# modprobe bfq
newmagic:~# for i in /sys/block/*/queue/scheduler; do echo $i; echo bfq > $i; cat $i; done
