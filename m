Yeah, UBLK provides one easy way for fast prototype.

Maybe it is one beginning for generic open-source userspace SSD FTL,
which could be useful for people curious in SSD internal. I have
google several times for such toolkit to see if it can be ported to
UBLK easily. SSD simulator isn't great, which isn't disk and can't handle
real data & workloads. With such project, SSD simulator could be less
useful, IMO.

We will keep improving ublk io path, and I am working on ublk
copy. Once it is done, big chunk IO latency could be reduced a lot.
