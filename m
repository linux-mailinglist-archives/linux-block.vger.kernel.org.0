I mean in this case, for the write IO, there is no need to split this IO
for the underlying disks that doesn't have BB, hence atomic write can
still work. Currently solution is to split the IO to the range that all
underlying disks doesn't have BB.

If you want this, then make sure raid will set fail fast together with
atomic write. This way disk will just faulty with IO error instead of
marking with BB, hence make sure there are no BBs.

No, we can't just kill it, unless all the disks behaves like:

never return IO error if the disk is still accessible, and once IO error
is returned, the disk is totally unusable.(This is what failfast means
in raid).

Thanks,
