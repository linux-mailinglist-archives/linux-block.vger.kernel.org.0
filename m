Reading through the description here and in the comment, and with the
caveat that I am familiar with network packet scheduling but not with
the IO layer, I think your approach sounds quite reasonable; and I'm
happy to see improvements in this area!

One question: How are equal-weight cgroups scheduled relative to each
other? Or requests from different processes within a single cgroup for
that matter? FIFO? Round-robin? Something else?

Thanks,
