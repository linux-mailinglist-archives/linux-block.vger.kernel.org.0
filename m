No.  In retrospective blk_cleanup_disk wan't the best idea for a few
reasons.  But at least it consolidated some of the code.

I don't want all of it together.  The important thing is that we have
two different concepts:

 - the gendisk is required to do file system style I/O
 - a standalone request_queue can be used for passthrough I/O.

Yes.  So we need to move the bits of blk_cleanup_queue that deal with
the file system I/O state to del_gendisk, and keep blk_cleanup_queue
for anything actually needed for the low-level queue.

To take SCSI as the example.  We can unload the sd/sr drivers and the
queue needs to still be around and work for use with the sg driver.

Interesting.  What were the symptoms in this case?
