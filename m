/dev/sg won't be accounted either.  But most importantly they are
accounted wrongly: the accounting buckets into read/write/discard.  Any
most pass through commands are everything but.

Also the way how this accounting works is completely broken.
Passthrough requests are sent through a request_queue, and it does
not make sense to account them to a block_device which sits way about
that.
