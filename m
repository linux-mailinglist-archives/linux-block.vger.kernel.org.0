Subject: [PATCH 01/13] bcache: add initial data structures for nvm pages

This patch initializes the prototype data structures for nvm pages
allocator,

- struct bch_nvm_pages_sb
This is the super block allocated on each nvdimm namespace. A nvdimm
set may have multiple namespaces, bch_nvm_pages_sb->set_uuid is used
to mark which nvdimm set this name space belongs to. Normally we will
use the bcache's cache set UUID to initialize this uuid, to connect this
nvdimm set to a specified bcache cache set.

- struct bch_owner_list_head
This is a table for all heads of all owner lists. A owner list records
which page(s) allocated to which owner. After reboot from power failure,
the ownwer may find all its requested and allocated pages from the owner
list by a handler which is converted by a UUID.

- struct bch_nvm_pages_owner_head
This is a head of an owner list. Each owner only has one owner list,
and a nvm page only belongs to an specific owner. uuid[] will be set to
owner's uuid, for bcache it is the bcache's cache set uuid. label is not
mandatory, it is a human-readable string for debug purpose. The pointer
*recs references to separated nvm page which hold the table of struct
bch_nvm_pgalloc_rec.

- struct bch_nvm_pgalloc_recs
This struct occupies a whole page, owner_uuid should match the uuid
in struct bch_nvm_pages_owner_head. recs[] is the real table contains all
allocated records.

- struct bch_pgalloc_rec
Each structure records a range of allocated nvm pages.
  - Bits  0 - 51: is pages offset of the allocated pages.
  - Bits 52 - 57: allocaed size in page_size * (1 << order)
  - Bits 58 - 63: reserved.
Since each of the allocated nvm pages are power of 2, using 6 bits to
represent allocated size can have (1<<(1<<64) - 1) * PAGE_SIZE maximum
value. It can be a 76 bits width range size in byte for 4KB page size,
which is large enough currently.
