well, introducing dm-pcache (assuming we use this name) could, on one 
hand, attract more users and developers from the device-mapper community 
to pay attention to this project, and on the other hand, serve as a way 
to validate or improve the dm framework’s performance in 
high-performance I/O scenarios. If necessary, we can enhance the dm 
framework instead of bypassing it entirely. This indeed sounds like 
something that would “benefit everyone.”

Hmm, I will seriously consider this approach.

Hi Alasdair, Mike, Mikulas,  Do you have any suggestions?

Thanx
