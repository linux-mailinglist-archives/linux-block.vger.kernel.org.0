Let me try to prove it's not a problem:

It's not interesting if didn't allocate from reserves as it won't affect
mempool. Neither we care about falsely avoiding pcpu cache, i.e. trying
to return into the mempool more than needed. So, the only potential race
problem that requires explanation is when the bio is from reserves but
we see that the mempool is full and it's not. Because of spinlocks
around ->curr_nr modifications and the fact that we won't see random
invented values, it might have only happened if there were both bio
allocations and bio puts strictly after our allocation, after
spin_unlock to be more specific. But then those puts and allocs are
serialised by the mutex, we can take a bio alloc that happened right
after a put that filled the mempool full and recurse all the reasoning.

I'm rusty on formal proves and it can be more formal, but would be
interesting to see if it's flawed and/or get a counter example.
In any case, it only returns more bios into mempool, which won't hurt
the issue.
