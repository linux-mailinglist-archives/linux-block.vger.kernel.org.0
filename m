Line 1 is not the relevant concern here. That would be relevant if we
were trying to verify the integrity of writes end-to-end immediately
after they'd been completed - and that would be a lovely thing to do in
the spirit of "true end to end data integrity", but we're not ready to
contemplate such things due to the obvious performance implications.

The scenario here is: we go to read old data, we get a bit error, and
then we want to retry the read to verify that it wasn't a transient
error before declaring it dead (marking it poisoned).

In this scenario, "dirty data in the writeback cache" is something that
would only ever happen if userspace is doing very funny things with
O_DIRECT, and the drive flushing that data on FUA read is totally fine.
It's an irrelevant corner case.

But we do absolutely require checking for transient read errors, and we
will miss things and corrupt data unnecessarily without FUA reads that
bypass the controller cache.

It's not data recovery - in the conventional sense.

Typically, on conventional filesystems, this doesn't come up because a:
most filesystems don't even do data checksumming, and even then on a
filesystem with data checksumming this won't automatically come up -
because like other other transient errors, it's generally perfectly
acceptable to return the error and let the upper layer retry later; the
filesystem generaly doesn't have to care if the error is transient or
not.

Where this becomes a filesystem concern is when those errors start
driving state changes within the filesystem, i.e. when we need to track
and know about them: in that case, we absolutely do need to try hard to
distinguish between transient and permanent errors.

Specifically, bcachefs needs to be able to move data around - even if
it's bitrotted and generating checksum errors. There's a couple
different reasons we may need to move data:

- rebalance, this is the task that does arbitrary data processing in the
  background based on user policy (moving it to a slower device,
  compressing it or recompressing it with a more expensive algorithm)

- copygc, which compacts fragmented data in mostly-empty buckets and is
  required for the allocator and the whole system to be able to make
  forward progress

- device evacuate/removal

Rebalance is optional (and still needs to bitrotted extents to be
tracked so that it doesn't spin on them, retrying them endlessly), but
copygc and evacuate are not.

And the only way for these processes to handle bitrotted extents
(besides throwing them out, which obviously we're not going to do) is

- generate a new checksum
- mark them as poisoned, so that reads to userspace still return the
  appropriate error (unless it's a read done with a "I know there's
  errors, give me what you still have" API).

But the critical thing here is, marking an extent as poisoned will turn
a transient corruption into a permanent error unless we've made damn
sure there is no transient error with additional FUA retries.
