Thanks for your suggestion. Using an eBPF program to read these internal status
from a host which is fully under your control is a good choice, but when
the dependencies of an eBPF program (e.g., the minor version of the kernel
and the kernel configuration which will influence the struct layout) is
out-of-your-control, it's not a good choice.

Thanks,
Tao
