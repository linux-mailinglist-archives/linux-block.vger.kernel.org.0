A comment is the minimum I can think of at the moment and
I'll prepare a fixup patch or a new version of this patch that adds
a proper comment for this function.
Other ways to protect the usage must be investigated. 
I have to discuss with Stefan what the best approach would be as the patchset
is supposed to be ready for upstream integration.

I'd prefer a fixup patch that we could send with at least one more fixup patch
that we have in the pipe already. Let's see. I hope that's fine with you
(and Jens obviously) so far.

Jan
