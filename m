It is similar, but not same.

So far, for each single request queue, we never support to allocate
request/tag from both sched tags and driver tags at the same.

If we clear RQF_ELV simply for pt request, at least:

1) blk_mq_hctx_has_requests() is broken since this function only checks
sched tags in case of q->elevator

2) q->nr_requests may not be respected any more in case of q->elevator

I guess it may work, but question is that what we can get from this kind
of big change? And I think this approach may be one following work if it is
proved as useful.
