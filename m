Hi Ming,

There always seems to be some confusion or disagreement on this topic.

I work according to the comment in scsi_host.h:

"Note: it is assumed that each hardware queue has a queue depth of
  can_queue. In other words, the total queue depth per host
  is nr_hw_queues * can_queue."

So I set Scsi_host.can_queue = HISI_SAS_MAX_COMMANDS (=4096)

Let's discuss this when I send the patches, so we don't get sidetracked 
on this blk-mq improvement topic.
