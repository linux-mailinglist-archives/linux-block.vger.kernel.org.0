Yes. The fixes that went into rc3 addressed the REQ_NOWAIT issue. So we are good
on this front.

My bad. I was talking about the io_uring rings. Not the block layer queues.

I was talking about the work that gets IOs submitted by the user from the rings
and turn them into BIOs for submission. My understanding is that these are not
synchronized. For a simple fio "--zonemode=zbd --rw=randwrite --numjobs=X" for X
> 1, the fio level synchronization will serialize the calls to io_submit() for
libaio, thus delivering the BIOs to a zone in order in the kernel. With io_uring
as the I/O engine, the same fio level synchronization happens but is only around
the IO getting in the ring. The IOs being turned into BIOs and submitted will be
done outside of the fio serialization and can thus can endup being issued out of
order if multiple rings are used. At least, that is my understanding of
io_uring... Am I getting this wrong ?
