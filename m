That is exactly what I want, but unlike pcie, nvmf creates the queue
using a connect request that is not driven from a user context. Hence
it would be nice to have an interface to get it done.

The alternative would be to make nvmf connect not use blk-mq, but that
is not a good alternative in my mind. Having a callback interface for
cpu hotplug is just another interface that every transport will need
to implement, and it makes nvmf different than pci.

That is not a concern what-so-ever. Queue resources are cheap enough
that we shouldn't have to care about it in this scale.
