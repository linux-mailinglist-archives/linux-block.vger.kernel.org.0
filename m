Ok, actually I just tested your change and it does work. I must have
done something slightly differently when I first tried it (I think I
added a handler which echoed messages which still let the SIGINTs
through to child processes but it works with the null string).

So:

The main code traps EXIT which calls the cleanup handler that this trap
then overrides SIGINT with, so I'm not really sure how they interact.

Thanks,
