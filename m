I'm not particularly found of this approach, as I think it's racy. Ie:
you would have to add some kind of lock to make sure the contents of
buffer_squeeze_end stay unmodified during the read and set cycle, or
else xen_blkif_schedule will race with xen_blkbk_reclaim_memory.

This is likely not a big deal ATM since the code will work as
expected in most cases AFAICT, but I would still prefer to have a
per-instance buffer_squeeze_end added to xen_blkif, given that the
callback is per-instance. I wouldn't call it a structural change, it's
just adding a variable to a struct instead of having a shared one, but
the code is almost the same as the current version.

Thanks, Roger.
