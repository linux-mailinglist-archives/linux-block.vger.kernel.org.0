Eww.

True.  I suspect the right thing might be to still only open the device
read-only.  Which brings us to the next mess that ->open for block
devices is only called once, but different openers might have different
flags (with write and nodelay being the once that matter).

We really should fail it.  Unlike the device open, where allowing it
feels wrong to me, but at least has use cases being able to create a
shared writable mmap doesn't have any point.

I think we need to absolutely reconsider it (in addition to your patch),
especially as I just got another report related to it.  I'll need to
talk to the DM folks to figure out if we can do a workaround in dm
somehow.
