+Shin'ichiro so that he is aware of the context.

Please share the blktest patch on this list so that we can see how you recreate
the issue. That makes it easier to see if a fix is appropriate.

I am still very confused about how this is possible assuming a well behaved user
that actually submits write BIOs in sequence for a zone. That means with a lock
around submit_bio() calls. Assuming such user, a large write BIO that is split
would have its fragments all processed and added to the target zone plug in
order. Another context (or the same context) submitting the next write for that
zone would have the same happen, so BIO fragments should not be reordered...

So to clarify: are we talking about splits of the BIO that the DM device
receives ? Or is it about splits of cloned BIOs that are used to process the
BIOs that the DM device received ? The clones are for the underlying device and
should not have the zone plugging flag set until the DM target driver submits
them, even if the original BIO is flagged with zone plugging. Looking at the bio
clone code, the bio flags do not seem to be copied from the source BIO to the
clone. So even if the source BIO (the BIO received by the DM device) is flagged
with zone write plugging, a clone should not have this flag set until it is
submitted.

Could you clarify the sequence and BIO flags you see that leads to the issue ?
