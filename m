Good to know...

So I hear there is a desire to do this. So I think we should list the
use-cases for this first because that would lead to different design
choices.. For example one use-case is just to send read/write/flush
to userspace, another may want to passthru nvme commands to userspace
and there may be others...

No surprise here...
