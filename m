Subject: [PATCH v5 00/19] Add Command Duration Limits support

Hello,

This series adds support for Command Duration Limits.
The series is based on linux tag: v6.3-rc5
The series can also be found in git:
https://github.com/floatious/linux/commits/cdl-v5


=================
CDL in ATA / SCSI
=================
Command Duration Limits is defined in:
T13 ATA Command Set - 5 (ACS-5) and
T10 SCSI Primary Commands - 6 (SPC-6) respectively
(a simpler version of CDL is defined in T10 SPC-5).

CDL defines Duration Limits Descriptors (DLD).
7 DLDs for read commands and 7 DLDs for write commands.
Simply put, a DLD contains a limit and a policy.

A command can specify that a certain limit should be applied by setting
the DLD index field (3 bits, so 0-7) in the command itself.

The DLD index points to one of the 7 DLDs.
DLD index 0 means no descriptor, so no limit.
DLD index 1-7 means DLD 1-7.

A DLD can have a few different policies, but the two major ones are:
-Policy 0xF (abort), command will be completed with command aborted error
(ATA) or status CHECK CONDITION (SCSI), with sense data indicating that
the command timed out.
-Policy 0xD (complete-unavailable), command will be completed without
error (ATA) or status GOOD (SCSI), with sense data indicating that the
command timed out. Note that the command will not have transferred any
data to/from the device when the command timed out, even though the
command returned success.

Regardless of the CDL policy, in case of a CDL timeout, the I/O will
result in a -ETIME error to user-space.

The DLDs are defined in the CDL log page(s) and are readable and writable.
Reading and writing the CDL DLDs are outside the scope of the kernel.
If a user wants to read or write the descriptors, they can do so using a
user-space application that sends passthrough commands, such as cdl-tools:
https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/cdl-tools/commits/cdl-v4


================================
The introduction of ioprio hints
================================
What the kernel does provide, is a method to let I/O use one of the CDL DLDs
defined in the device. Note that the kernel will simply forward the DLD index
to the device, so the kernel currently does not know, nor does it need to know,
how the DLDs are defined inside the device.

The way that the CDL DLD index is supplied to the kernel is by introducing a
new 10 bit "ioprio hint" field within the existing 16 bit ioprio definition.

Currently, only 6 out of the 16 ioprio bits are in use, the remaining 10 bits
are unused, and are currently explicitly disallowed to be set by the kernel.

For now, we only add ioprio hints representing CDL DLD index 1-7. Additional
ioprio hints for other QoS features could be defined in the future.

A theoretical future work could be to make an I/O scheduler aware of these
hints. E.g. for CDL, an I/O scheduler could make use of the duration limit
in each descriptor, and take that information into account while scheduling
commands. Right now, the ioprio hints will be ignored by the I/O schedulers.


==============================
How to use CDL from user-space
==============================
Since CDL is mutually exclusive with NCQ priority
(see ncq_prio_enable and sas_ncq_prio_enable in
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-block-device),
CDL has to be explicitly enabled using:
echo 1 > /sys/block/$bdev/device/cdl_enable

Since the ioprio hints are supplied through the existing I/O priority API,
it should be simple for an application to make use of the ioprio hints.

It simply has to reuse one of the new macros defined in
include/uapi/linux/ioprio.h: IOPRIO_PRIO_HINT() or IOPRIO_PRIO_VALUE_HINT(),
and supply one of the new hints defined in include/uapi/linux/ioprio.h:
IOPRIO_HINT_DEV_DURATION_LIMIT_[1-7], which indicates that the I/O should
use the corresponding CDL DLD index 1-7.

By reusing the I/O priority API, the user can both define a DLD to use per
AIO (io_uring sqe->ioprio or libaio iocb->aio_reqprio) or per-thread
(ioprio_set()).


=======
Testing
=======
With the following fio patches:
https://github.com/floatious/fio/commits/cdl-v4

fio adds support for ioprio hints, such that CDL can be tested using e.g.:
fio --ioengine=io_uring --cmdprio_percentage=10 --cmdprio_hint=DLD_index

A simple way to test is to use a DLD with a very short duration limit,
and send large reads. Regardless of the CDL policy, in case of a CDL
timeout, the I/O will result in a -ETIME error to user-space.

We also provide a CDL test suite located in the cdl-tools repo, see:
https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/cdl-tools/blob/cdl-v4/README.md#testing-a-system-command-duration-limits-support


We have tested this patch series using:
-real hardware
-the following QEMU implementation:
https://github.com/floatious/qemu/tree/cdl
(NOTE: the QEMU implementation requires you to define the CDL policy at compile
time, so you currently need to recompile QEMU when switching between policies.)


===================
Further information
===================
For further information about CDL, see Damien's slides:

================
Changes since V4
================
-Rebased on v6.3-rc5.
-Patch "ata: libata: set read/write commands CDL index" now takes the CDL
 index from the SCSI cdb, instead of looking at the IO prio hint directly.
 In other words, libata will now translate a SCSI passthrough READ_16 and
 WRITE_16 command with a pre-existing CDL index correctly.
