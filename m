I haven't done a massive amount of analysis of this patch, but since I
noticed it while debugging my own block series I've been keeping track
of it.  Is there any status update here?  We've been carrying this
"FROMLIST" in our Chrome OS trees for a little while, but that's not a
state we want to be in long-term.  If it needs to spin before landing
upstream we should get the spin out and land it.  If it's OK as-is
then it'd be nice to see it in mainline.

From the above I guess Salman was waiting for Jens to weigh in with an
opinion on the prefered bike shed color?
