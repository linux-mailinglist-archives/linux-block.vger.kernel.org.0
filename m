Okay, great.

If I understand correctly, because of the timeout now set to 30s,
MMC_RSP_BUSY becomes disabled in __mmc_switch() for your case in
sdhci-tegra as well?

In other words, mmc_poll_for_busy() is being called, which in your
case means the ->card_busy() host ops (set to sdhci_card_busy() in
your case) will be invoked to wait for the card to stop signal busy on
DAT0.

This indicates to me, that the ->card_busy() ops returns zero to
inform that the card is *not* busy, even if the card actually signals
busy? Is that correct?

So, yes, using R1 instead of R1B triggers a different behaviour, but
according to the eMMC spec it's perfectly allowed to issue a CMD13
even if the card signals busy on DAT0. The CMD13 is not using the DATA
lines, so this should work.

If I understand correctly, your driver (and controller?) has issues
with coping with this scenario. Is it something that can be fixed?

status CMD13 but during that time on device side looks like still processin=

Right, as stated above, isn't sdhci_card_busy() working for your case?
Can we fix it?

I fully agree that R1B is preferable, but it's not against the spec to
send CMD13 to poll for busy.

Moreover, we need to cope with the scenario when the host has
specified a maximum timeout that isn't sufficiently long enough for
the requested operation. Do you have another proposal for how to
manage this, but disabling MMC_RSP_BUSY?

Let's assume you driver would get a R1B for the CMD6 (we force it),
then what timeout would the driver be using if we would set
cmd.busy_timeout to 30ms?

Kind regards
Uffe
