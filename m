As discussed offline, the code that suffers the performance regression
is downstream, and since this change seems to be important, I can apply
the helper LTO patch downstream as well.

Since the plan for the downstream code _is_ to move upstream, I really
hope to see the helper LTO patch upstream, so we don't get a performance
regression because of these refcounts.

If we cannot figure out a way to get the LTO patches (or an alternative
solution) upstream, we can always revert back to a more performant
solution in block.
