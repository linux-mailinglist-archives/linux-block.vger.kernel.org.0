Just to give urgency to Bart's request: we have two or three weeks
before the kernel is due to go final.  Can the problems identified by
Christoph be fixed within that timeframe?

Specifically, looking at the paper you reference, it only uses READ
BUFFER for the host cache sharing.  Since the JDEC standard appears to
be proprietary, I have no method of understanding why the driver now
uses WRITE BUFFER as well, but it appears to be a simple optimization. 
If you can cut out the WRITE BUFFER code, blk_insert_cloned_request()
will also be gone and thus the API abuse.  Can you get us a simple
patch doing this ASAP so we don't have to revert the driver?
