Mike, thanks for the positive comment. Now I know that there are various
testsuites related to dm as you noted below. I think the new dm test group in
blktests can have different coverage from other dm related testsuites: tests to
confirm fixes for failures related to block layer and device-mapper. The new
test Yu Kuai suggests will fit into it.

Yu, could you post the new version of your patch? Let's add the dm group and the
first test case.

Thanks. Good to know that dm test has wide varieties. I found the testsuites on
the net. Will try to look into them.

[1] lvm2: https://github.com/lvmteam/lvm2/tree/master/test
[2] cryptsetup: https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/tree/main/tests
[3] mptest: https://github.com/snitm/mptest
[4] device-mapper-test-suite: https://github.com/jthornber/device-mapper-test-suite

It sounds a valuable action to gather the various testsuites so that the dm
maintainer or dm developers can run them all easily.

I also think that the list of testsuites will help developers to tell what kind
of test goes to which testsuite. When an developer adds a test case related to
dm, the developer needs to choose which testsuite to add it. As an example, I
wonder about dm-zoned. In case we would add test cases to exercise dm-zoned, is
there any good testsuite to add them? (Can we set up dm-zoned with dmtest-
python?)

IIUC, the dmtest-python takes the role to prepare the various DM targets for
test, and each testsuite runs test cases on the targets, right? From blktests
point of view, the "block" group of blktests can be run with the various DM
targets. Also the "zbd" group of blktests can be run with DM targets with
DM_TARGET_ZONED_HM feature. Other test groups such as "nvme" or "scsi" won't
run with DM targets. I think it is not difficult for dmtest-python to prepare
blktests config files to specify DM targets and the block/zbd test group. If
blktests side change is desired, we can discuss.
