You may missed my first rfc.

I also patched dmzadm(will sent out soon) a lot, now my implementation can compatible with original usage.

It supports two different usage:
- Original zoned device only:
#: dmzadm --format $zoned_dev
#: echo "0 $size zoned $zoned_dev" | dmsetup create $dm-zoned-name
(All data in zoned device)

- With regular device：
dmzadm --format $zoned_dev --regular=$regu_dev
echo "0 $size zoned $regu_dev $zoned_dev" | dmsetup create $dm-zoned-name
(Metadata in regular device, other data spread in both regular device and zoned device.)

I haven't thought about store metadata in zoned dev while other data in both cache/regular device and zoned dev.
Actually in my first rfc I just plan to split metadata to a fast device, so as to get performance improvement.

Sure.

Fine to me, just please keep my signed-off-by.

Thanks,
