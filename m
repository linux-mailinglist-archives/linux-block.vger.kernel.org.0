Huh?

#define blk_noretry_request(rq) \
        ((rq)->cmd_flags & (REQ_FAILFAST_DEV|REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT| \
                             REQ_FAILFAST_DRIVER))

making the only _actual_ change in your patch _not_ evaluating the
REQ_FAILFAST_DRIVER, which incidentally is only used by the NVMe core.
So what is it you're trying to solve?

Cheers,

Hannes
