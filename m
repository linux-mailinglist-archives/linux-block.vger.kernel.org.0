When 32MB chunk read with direct I/O option is comming from userspace,
kernel behavior is below now. it's timeline.

 | bio merge for 32MB. total 8,192 pages are merged.
 | total elapsed time is over 2ms.
 |------------------ ... ----------------------->|
                                                 | 8,192 pages merged a bio.
                                                 | at this time, first bio submit is done.
                                                 | 1 bio is split to 32 read request and issue.
                                                 |--------------->
                                                  |--------------->

                                                                   |--------------->

                                                                                     | 
                          total 19ms elapsed to complete 32MB read done from device. |

If bio max size is limited with 1MB, behavior is changed below.

 | bio merge for 1MB. 256 pages are merged for each bio.
 | total 32 bio will be made.
 | total elapsed time is over 2ms. it's same.
 | but, first bio submit timing is fast. about 100us.
 |--->|--->|--->|---> ... -->|--->|--->|--->|--->|
      | 256 pages merged a bio.
      | at this time, first bio submit is done.
      | and 1 read request is issued for 1 bio.
      |--------------->
           |--------------->
                |--------------->
                                      ......
                                                 |--------------->
                                                  |--------------->|
                                                                   | 
        total 17ms elapsed to complete 32MB read done from device. | 


As a result, read request issue timing is faster if bio max size is limited.
Current kernel behavior with multipage bvec, super large bio can be created.
And it lead to delay first I/O request issue.
