Yeah, that is why I thought the tag could be reused for the spawned(cloned)
request, but it needs ufshpb developer to confirm, or at least
ufshcd_queuecommand() can handle this situation. If that is true, it isn't
necessary to use reserve tags, since the current blk-mq implementation
requires to reserve real hardware tags space, which has to take normal
tags.
