I  am also interested in this discussion. Every SSD manufacturer =
carefully hides
the details of architecture and FTL=E2=80=99s behavior. I believe that =
switching on bigger
logical size (like 8KB, 16KB, etc) could be even better for SSD's =
internal mapping
scheme and erase blocks management. I assume that it could require =
significant
reworking the firmware and, potentially, ASIC logic. This could be the =
main pain
for SSD manufactures. Frankly speaking, I don=E2=80=99t see the direct =
relation between
increasing logical block size and increasing write amplification. If you =
have 16KB
logical block size on SSD side and file system will continue to use 4KB =
logical
block size, then, yes, I can see the problem. But if file system manages =
the space
in 16KB logical blocks and carefully issue the I/O requests of proper =
size, then
everything should be good. Again, FTL is simply trying to write logical =
blocks into
erase block. And we have, for example, 8MB erase block, then mapping and =
writing
16KB logical blocks looks like more beneficial operation compared with =
4KB logical
block.

So, I see more troubles on file systems side to support bigger logical =
size. For example,
we discussed the 8KB folio size support recently. Matthew already shared =
the patch
for supporting 8KB folio size, but everything should be carefully =
tested. Also, I experienced
the issue with read ahead logic. For example, if I format my file system =
volume with 32KB
logical block, then read ahead logic returns to me 16KB folios that was =
slightly surprising
to me. So, I assume we can find a lot of potential issues on file =
systems side for bigger
logical size from the point of view of efficiency of metadata and user =
data operations.
Also, high-loaded systems could have fragmented memory that could make =
the memory
allocation more tricky operation. I mean here that it could be not easy =
to allocate one big
folio. Log-structured file systems can easily aligned write I/O requests =
for bigger logical
size. But in-place update file systems can increase write amplification =
for bigger logical
size because of necessity to flush bigger portion of data for small =
modification. However,
FTL can use delta-encoding and smart logic of compaction several logical =
blocks into
one NAND flash page. And, by the way, NAND flash page usually is bigger =
than 4KB.

Thanks,
Slava.
