True - but I would assume busy from queuecommand() is different from 
BUSY/QUEUE_FULL via a SCSI response.

Adapter queuecommand busy's can be for out-of-resource limits in the 
driver - such as I_T io count limits enforced by the driver are reached, 
or if some other adapter resource limit is reached as well. Canqueue 
covers most of those - but we sometimes overcommit the adapter with a 
canqueue on physical port as well as per npiv ports, or scsi and nvme on 
the same port.

Going back to Bart's question - with SANS and multiple initiators 
sharing a target and lots of luns on that target, it's very common to 
hit bursty conditions where the target may reply with QUEUE_FULL.  Many 
arrays provide think tuning guides on how to set up values on multiple 
hosts, but it's mainly to help the target avoid being completely overrun 
as some didn't do so well.   In the end, it's very hard to predict 
multi-initiator load and in a lot of cases, things are usually left a 
bit overcommitted as the performance downside otherwise is significant.
