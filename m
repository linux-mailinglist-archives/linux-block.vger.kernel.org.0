It does seem like a rat hole of sorts. Because then you start adding code to
guesstimate how big the request could roughly be, and if you miss a bit,
you get a request that's tiny in between the normal sized ones.

Or you'd clone, and then you could still have them inflight in parallel.
But then you're paying the cost of that...
