Hi Alasdair,

Thank you for your time and comments.

This is proposed in order to detect if I/O errors have occurred on the dm device. Deriving this from the ioerr_cnt from the underlying device was considered, but it's not reliable for dm devices that tolerate some underlying errors (raid setups and similar).

Our use case is to detect if I/O errors have happened at all. We expect the ioerr_cnt to increase when there are errors, but the precise number is not important in our environment.

I'm not very familiar with dm and I don't follow how the cloning and stacking will lead to multiplication. Do you have any suggestions for how I might deal with that?

Resetting the value would not be desirable for our use case, because the probing process can miss I/O errors that happen right before a device is suspended and then resumed, though I can imagine that there might be cases where one would want that. Users could look at increases in ioerr_cnt instead of the absolute numbers, or I could provide a way to reset the counter if desired.

I will be happy to provide an updated patch with inline documentation once I have addressed your comments. Are there any other places where I need to update documentation?
