An application would have to know about zones and their writeable capacity. To decide where and how data is written, an application must manage writing across zones, specific offline zones, and (currently) its writeable capacity. I.e., knowledge about zones and holes is required for writing to zoned devices and isn't eliminated by removing the PO2 zone size requirement.

Supporting offlines zones is optional in the ZNS spec? We are not
considering supporting this in the host. This will be handled by the
device for exactly maintaining the SW stack simpler.

They have communicated the PO2 requirement clearly, there's good precedence working with PO2 zone sizes, and at last, holes can't be avoided and are part of the overall design of zoned storage devices. So why should the kernel developer's take on the long-term maintenance burden of NPO2 zone sizes?

You have a good point, and that is the question we need to help answer.
As I see it, requirements evolve and the kernel changes with it as long
as there are active upstream users for it.

The main constraint for PO2 is removed in the block layer, we have Linux
hosts stating that unmapped LBAs are a problem, and we have HW
supporting size=capacity.

I would be happy to hear what else you would like to see for this to be
of use to the kernel community.
