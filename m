You are talking about multi-lun case, and your change does affect
multi-lun code path, but your test result doesn't cover multi-lun,
is it enough?

At least your patch shouldn't cause performance regression on multi-lun IO
workloads, right?

What I meant is that SATA's queue depth is often 32 or 31, and still have
multi-lun cases.

At least from what you shared, the fair tag sharing doesn't work well
just because of low queue depth, nothing is actually related with UFS.

That is why I am wondering that why not force to disable fairing sharing
in case of low queue depth.

I don't object to take the disabling fair sharing first, and I meant that
the fairness may be brought back by adjusting scsi_device's queue depth in
future.


Thanks,
