Don't remember that either, so I'd have to dig out emails! But looking
at it now, for the async case with io_uring, the iocb is embedded in the
io_kiocb from io_uring. We hold two references to the io_kiocb, one for
submit and one for completion. Hence even if the bio completes
immediately and someone else finds the completion before the application
doing this submit, we still hold the submission reference to the
io_kiocb. Hence I don't really see how we can end up with a
use-after-free situation here.

IIRC, Bijan had traces showing this can happen, KASAN complaining about
it. Which makes me think that I'm missing a case here, though I don't
immediately see what it is.

Bijan, could post your trace again, I can't seem to find it?
