Subject: [PATCH 2/5] block: switch all files cleared marked as GPLv2 or later to SPDX tags
Date:   Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:42:40 -0400
Message-Id: <20190430184243.23436-3-hch@lst.de>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.20.1
In-Reply-To: <20190430184243.23436-1-hch@lst.de>
References: <20190430184243.23436-1-hch@lst.de>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
X-SRS-Rewrite: SMTP reverse-path rewritten from <hch@infradead.org> by bombadil.infradead.org. See http://www.infradead.org/rpr.html
Sender: linux-block-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-block.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-block@vger.kernel.org

All these files have some form of the usual GPLv2 or later boilerplate.
Switch them to use SPDX tags instead.
