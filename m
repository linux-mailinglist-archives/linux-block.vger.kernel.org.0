Possible, but not very practical:
    1) apply supplied 83 patches to sg driver
    2) apply pending patch to scsi_debug driver
    3) find a stable kernel platform (perhaps not lk 5.12.0-rc1)
    4) run supplied scripts for three weeks
    5) dig through the output and maybe find one case (there were lots
       of EAGAINs from blk_get_request() but they are expected when
       thrashing the storage layers)


My basic testing strategy may be useful for others:
     sg_dd iflag=random bs=512 of=/dev/sg6
     sg_dd if=/dev/sg6 bs=512 of=/dev/sg7
     sg_dd --verify if=/dev/sg6 bs=512 of=/dev/sg7

If the copy works, so should the verify (compare). The sg_dd utility in
sg3_utils release 1.46 is needed to support iflag=random in the first
line and the --verify in the third line.

If the backing LLD is scsi_debug, then per_host_store=1 is needed. Best
not to use SSDs. The above pattern will work just as well for /dev/sd*
device nodes, but iflag= and oflag= lists must contain the sgio flag.
Then ioctl(/dev/sd*, SG_IO, ...) is used for IO. The limitations of the
third line could be bypassed with something like:
     cmp /dev/sd6 /dev/sd7

If real disks are used, all user data will be trashed.
