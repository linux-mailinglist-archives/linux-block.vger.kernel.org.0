"REQ_TAG" is so generic yet is used in such a specific way (to mark an
FS bio as having polling context)

I don't have a great suggestion for a better name, just seems "REQ_TAG"
is lacking... (especially given the potential for confusion due to
blk-mq's notion of "tag").

REQ_FS? REQ_FS_CTX? REQ_POLL? REQ_POLL_CTX? REQ_NAMING_IS_HARD :)

Maybe others have better ideas?
