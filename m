You're comparing apples and oranges. I don't want to get into (fairly)
ancient history at this point, but the original implementation was honed
with the nvme conversion - which is the most performant driver/hardware
we have available.

Converting something that doesn't need a scheduler, doesn't need
timeouts, doesn't benefit from merging, doesn't need tagging etc doesn't
make a lot of sense. If you need none of that, *of course* you're going
to see a slowdown from doing all of these extra things by default.
That's pretty obvious.

This isn't about workloads at all.
