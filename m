The above sentence may be correct for ATA disks, but for SCSI disks the CDL log
page is for statistics. Those statistics counters can be reset (to zero) but
are not writable in the normal sense. To "define" (or change from the default
values) CDL settings in SCSI, the CDL _mode_ pages are provided. Confusingly
there are four such mode pages (A, B, T2A and T2B). Which one(s) do you
support/use?
