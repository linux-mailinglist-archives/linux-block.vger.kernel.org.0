The registration is a user space process, not a kthread/kworker. The
created kthread is for later run time purpose as part of initialization.
The problem is, if there is pending signal, creating kthread will fail
and return -EINTR to caller, then the whole registration will fail.

And all the work has to be completed before the kernel code (by a write
syscall via sysfs interface) returns to the user space process. After
the registration process finished, the bcache disk file like
/dev/bcache0 will show up for following mount. A delayed lazy method is
not feasible here.

I see. But so far I don't have better solution to fix this problem.
Asking people to do extra configure to udev rules is very tricky, most
of common users will be scared. I need to get it fixed by no-extra
configuration.

You are right, the cached data is not bonded to process, it is bonded to
specific backing block devices.

In my case, kthread_run()/kthread_create() is called in context of
registration process (/lib/udev/bcache-register), so it is unnecessary
to worry about kthread address space. So maybe I can check
tsk_is_oom_victim to judge whether current process is killing by OOM
killer other then simply calling pending_signal() ?

I see your concern. But the udev timeout is global for all udev rules, I
am not sure whether change it to a very long time is good ... (indeed I
tried to add event_timeout=3600 but I can still see the signal received).

Ignore the pending signal in bcache registering code is the only method
currently I know to avoid bcache auto-register failure in boot time. If
there is other way I can achieve the same goal, I'd like to try.

BTW, by the mean time, I am still looking for the reason why
event_timeout=3600 in /etc/udev/udev.conf does not take effect...
