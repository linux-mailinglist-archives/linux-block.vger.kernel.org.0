First of all, I would like to keep the critical section as small as possible.
With my small test, I could see slightly increasing memory pressure as the
critical section becomes wider.  Also, some drivers might share the data their
'reclaim_memory' callback touches with other functions.  I think only the
driver owners can know what data is shared and what is the minimum critical
section to protect it.

If you think differently or I am missing something, please let me know.
