Conceptually the patch certainly makes sense, and is probably as close
to ideal on tag reservations as we can get without making things a lot
more complicated (or relying on extra app input).

But it does mean we'll always be doing a second loop over the submission
list, which is obviously not ideal in terms of overhead. I can see a few
potential ways forward:

1) Maybe just submit directly if plugging isn't required? That'd leave
   the pending list just the items that do plug, and avoid the extra
   loop for those that don't.

2) At least get something out of the extra loop - alloc and prep
   requests upfront, then submit. If we have to do N things to submit a
   request, it's always going to be better to bundle each sub-step. This
   patch doesn't do that, it just kind of takes the easy way out.

What do you think? I think these are important questions to answer,
particularly as the overhead of flushing extraneous tags seem pretty
minuscule.
