Copied. Then let me try how to make event_timeout works on my udevd. If
it works without other side effect, I will revert existing
flush_signals() patches.

Indeed now the bcache registration can not be killed. I guess it is
because the mutex lock held during the metadata checking.
Sure I will look at how to extend udevd timeout value now, and ask for
help later.

Thanks.
