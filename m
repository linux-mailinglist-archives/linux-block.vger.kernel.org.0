Fine. I indeed didn't follow linux-dm.git. Sorry it's my fault.

I just want to send in one email, which seems obviously improper.

Though I have noticed this series discussion yesterday, I didn't read it
thoroughly until today. When I noticed there may be one remained issue
(I know it is not now), the patch, that is commit 22ada802ede8 has been
adopt by Jens, so I send out a patch. If there's no Jens' reply, I will
just reply under your mail. That's it. I have to admit that I get
excited when I realized that I could send a patch. But it seems improper
and more likely a misunderstanding. I apologize if I did wrong.

Got it. Thanks.

I mistakenly missed that all these changes are introduced in v5.10.
Sorry for that.

This is indeed a difference between 5.9 and 5.10. In 5.10 there may be
more small split bios, since a smaller chunk_sectors is applied for the
underlying device with larger chunk_sectors (that is, the underlying
device with 128K chunk_sectors). I can not say that more small split
bios will cause worse performance since I have not tested it.

Yes I misremember it.

I used Linus' tree as my code base, which seems improper...
