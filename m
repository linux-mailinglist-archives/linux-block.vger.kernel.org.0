While waiting for your answer, I've added also the direct-I/O case to
my test.  Now we have also this new case reproduced by the command
line reported in the draft.

Even with direct I/O, nothing changes with writers as interferers,
apart from latency becoming at least equal to the case of no I/O
control for the HDD.  Summing up, with writers as interferers (latency
in ms):

            no I/O control        io.latency         BFQ
NVMe SSD     3                     3                 0.2
SATA SSD     3                     3                 0.2
HDD          56                    56                13

In contrast, there are important improvements with the SSDs, in case
of readers as interferers.  This is the new situation (latency still
in ms):

            no I/O control        io.latency         BFQ
NVMe SSD     1.9                   0.08              0.07
SATA SSD     39                    0.2               0.7
HDD          4500                  118               11
