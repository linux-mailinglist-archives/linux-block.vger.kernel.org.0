lsscsi is a command line utility that probes sysfs in Linux 2.6, 3,
4 and 5 series kernels in order to list information about SCSI
devices and SCSI hosts. The default format is one device (e.g. disk)
per line. Other storage devices that use the SCSI subsystem such as
SATA disks and USB keys are also listed. The previous version (0.30)
added listings of NVMe namespaces (devices)

This version is mainly for bug fixes. Version 0.31 is available at:
     http://sg.danny.cz/scsi/lsscsi.html
More information can be found on that page including examples
plus a Download and Build information section.

ChangeLog:
Version 0.31 2020/02/20 [svn: r160]
   - fix issue where host managed ZBC devices don't
     output their size. [Fix also for RBC and CD/DVD.]
   - exclude NVMe listings when --classic given
   - fix hex counting issues
   - supply "-" for generic NVMe device one line output
     so 'lsscsi -gb' output is consistent
   - cleanup gcc-8 warnings, no cleanup needed for gcc-9

Version 0.30 2018/06/12 [svn: r154]
   - add support for NVMe devices and controllers
   ....
