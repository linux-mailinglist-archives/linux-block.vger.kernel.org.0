>The call to blk_crypto_rq_bio_prep() from blk_rq_prep_clone() could also fail for the same reason. So we may need to make blk_crypto_rq_bio_prep() also return a bool and handle the errors in the callers (the only other caller is I think blk_mq_bio_to_request(), which explicitly calls the function with GFP_NOIO, so maybe we could explicitly document the fact that blk_mq_bio_to_request will return true when called with a gfp_mask th
at includes GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM, and ignore the return value in blk_mq_bio_to_request()). (And maybe we should document the same for bio_crypt_set_ctx and bio_crypt_clone?)

Agreed.
Except for above suggestions, the patch looks good for me, many thanks.
