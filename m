Eek no, let's not go that far!

That might break existing use cases. I say just leave it alone. If you
pick a name that already exists in /dev, then too bad for you.

What I cared most about fixing here was situation of having an empty
directory and being able to mkdir nullb0 when that was already assigned.
And that's fixed with your patches.
