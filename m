Btw, please properly format your mail.  These overly long lines are really

Good.

And now taking a step back:  Why do we even need this extra module
reference?  For the case where nbd_alloc_config is called from nbd_open
we obviously don't need it.  In the case where it is called from
nbd_genl_connect that prevents unloading nbd when there is a configured
but not actually nbd device.  Which isn't reallyed need and counter to
how other drivers work.

Did you try just removing the extra module refcounting?
