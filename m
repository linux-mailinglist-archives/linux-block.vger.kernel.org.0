Hi folks,

This series is for bcache-tools to support making zoned device as
bcache backing device.

There are two major ideas to support zoned device as bcache backing
device,
- The super block data_offset should be aligned to zone size. By default
  the data_offset is set to 1 zone size for zoned backing device.
- Writeback mode is not supported yet. If the cache mode is explicitly
  set to writeback, print message to terminal to inform users that the
  cache mode is converted to wrightthough.

After the data_offset and cache mode is set properly, the rested stuffs
for zoned device support are from bcache driver in Linux kernel.

Thanks for your review in advance.
