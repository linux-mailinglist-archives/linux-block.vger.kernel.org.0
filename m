Yes, this was considered back when blk-crypto-fallback was being added.
But it is useful to support blk-crypto unconditionally without userspace
having to set up a dm device:

- It allows testing the inline encryption code paths in ext4 and f2fs
  with xfstests on any system, just by adding the inlinecrypt mount
  option.  See e.g.
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20191031205045.GG16197@mit.edu/
  and 
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20200515170059.GA1009@sol.localdomain/

- It allows upper layers to just use blk-crypto instead of having both
  blk-crypto and non-blk-crypto code paths.  While I've been late on
  converting fscrypt to actually rely on this, it still might be a good
  idea, especially as we now need to revisit the code for reasons like
  large folio support.  (And Christoph seems to support this too -- see
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20250715062112.GC18672@lst.de/)

But, as suggested at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20250717044342.GA26995@lst.de/ it
should also be okay to reorganize things so that the regular
submit_bio() does not support the fallback, and upper layers have to
call a different function blk_crypto_fallback_submit_bio() if they want
the fallback.  I don't think that would help with the splitting issue
directly, but perhaps we could make the filesystems just not submit bios
that would need splitting by blk-crypto-fallback, which would solve the
issue.
