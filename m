OK, thanks for the detailed explanation!

Also you may switch to map each request queue/disk into a FD, and every
request is mapped to one fixed extent of the 'file' via rq->tag since we
have max sectors limit for each request, then fd limits can be avoided.

But I am wondering if this way is friendly to userspace side implementation,
since there isn't buffer, only FDs visible to userspace.


thanks,
Ming
