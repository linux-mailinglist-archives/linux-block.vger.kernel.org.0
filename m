I'd frame this differently:

 - del_gendisk is the right place to freeze the queue, as that is where the
   gendisk is unregistered and all fs I/O needs to stop.  If we don't get
   all aspects right we need to fix.  As mentioned I'm already looking into
   keeping a reference for the bio life time for bio based drivers.
 - SCSI is the only driver that ever submits passthrough I/O without the
   gendisk.  So doing an additional freeze during request_queue teardown
   is only needed for SCSI and we can eventually remove that for everyone
   else.  And most of your series already does really good work towards that
   goal!
