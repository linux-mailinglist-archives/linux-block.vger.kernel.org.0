Hi Bart,

So I take this approach as I don't see any way to use a mutual exclusion 
waiting mechanism to block calls to blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() while the 
IO scheduler is being switched.

The reason is that blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() can be called from any 
context, including hardirq.

I don't like to think that we're skipping it, which may imply that there 
are some active requests to iter and we're just ignoring them.

It's more like: we know that there are no requests active, so don't 
bother trying to iterate.

Again, I would be relying on all request_queues associated with that 
tagset to be queisced when switching IO scheduler at the point 
blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() is called and returns early.

Now if there were active requests, I am relying on the request queue 
quiescing to flush them. So blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() could be called 
during that quiescing period, and would continue to iter the requests.

This does fall over if some tags are allocated without associated 
request queue, which I do not know exists.

Thanks,
John
