Ugh, I guess that Jaehyun had this patch bottled up and didn't rebase
before submitting.. Sorry about that.

You ran this with nvme? or null_blk? I guess neither would benefit
from this because if the underlying device will not benefit from
batching (at least enough for the extra cost of accounting for it) it
will be counter productive to use this scheduler.

I think this is the right one:
https://github.com/i10-kernel/upstream-linux/blob/master/i10-evaluation.pdf

We had some back and forth around the naming, hence this was probably
omitted.
