Even if the standard doesn't say, it's perfectly possible that the
storage device implements it.

Hence, $subject patch isn't changing anything in regards to REQ_FUA,
unless the eMMC device/vendor has agreed to this (via the MMC card
quirks).

It's not a separate issue for eMMC. Please read the complete commit
message for further clarifications in this regard.

Yes, you are correct. Again, the card quirk (as suggested in $subject
patch) helps us to manage eMMC cards in different ways. We should not
avoid REQ_FUA (reliable writes) for an eMMC that actually needs it.

Can you please elaborate on this?

The tests we have done so far indicate that performance differs based
upon what eMMC we are using, for example.

Kind regards
