This comment seems to be in the wrong place, as dm_update_keyslot_manager()
already assumes that the crypto capabilities are either staying the same or
expanding.  This isn't something new that this WARN_ON() introduces.

I think this explanation should go in dm_table_construct_keyslot_manager()
instead, as that is where the new set of crypto capabilities is built.
I.e. in dm_table_construct_keyslot_manager() we should explain how we "know"
that the new set will really be equal or greater.
