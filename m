Please work with all google stakeholders to post the latest code for the
dm-bow and dm-default-key targets and I'll work through them.

I think the more code we have to inform DM core's implementation the
better off we'll be in the long run.  Could also help improve these
targets as a side-effect of additional review.

I know I largely ignored dm-bow before but that was more to do with
competing tasks, etc.  I'll try my best...

Sure, that context really helps.

About "basically, anything that doesn't change the data itself as it
goes through": could you be a bit more precise?  Very few DM targets
actually change the data as associated bios are remapped.

I'm just wondering if your definition of "doesn't change the data"
includes things more subtle than the data itself?

Thanks,
Mike
