But the backend can't know whether a node exists because the present
frontend has written it, or because an earlier instance forgot to
delete it. It can only honor what's there. (In fact the other day I
was wondering whether some of the writes of boolean "false" nodes
wouldn't better be xenbus_rm() instead.)
