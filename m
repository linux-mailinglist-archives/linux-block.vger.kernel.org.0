Right, if you asked for NOWAIT, then it would not necessarily succeed if
it:

1) Needs multiple bios
2) Needs splitting

You're expected to attempt blocking issue at that point. Reasoning is
explained in this (and the previous commit related to the issue),
otherwise you end up with potentially various amounts of the request
being written to disk or read from disk, but EAGAIN being returned for
the request as a whole.
