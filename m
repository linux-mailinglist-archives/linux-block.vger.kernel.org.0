OK, fair enough.

I think it is highly possible. Will you work a patch to convert to
per-request-queue sched tag?

No, there are just two LUNs, the 1st LUN is one commodity SSD(queue
depth is 32) and the performance issue is reported on this LUN, another is one
HDD(queue depth is 256) which is root disk, but the megaraid host tag depth is
228, another weird setting. But the issue still can be reproduced after we set
2nd LUN's depth as 64 for avoiding driver tag contention.
