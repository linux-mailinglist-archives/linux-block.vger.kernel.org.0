You have some high quality revisionist history there. But other than
pointing that out I'm not going to dwell on our past discussions on how
NVMe multipathing would be.

Red Hat supports both native nvme-multipath _and_ DM-multipath on NVMe.

The only "pain" I've been living with is trying to get you to be
impartial and allow others to provide Linux multipathing as they see
fit.

Please spare me the vapid and baseless assertion about patches you
refuse to review technically without political motivation.

> In other words: please get your house in order NOW.

My simple 3 patch submission was an attempt to do so. Reality is the
Linux NVMe maintainers need to get their collective house in order.

Until sanity prevails these NVMe changes will be carried in RHEL. And if
you go out of your way to cause trivial, or elaborate, conflicts now
that you _know_ that changes that are being carried it will be handled
without issue.

Sad this is where we are but it is what it is.

Linux is about choice that is founded upon need. Hostile action that
unilaterally limits choice is antithetical to Linux and Open Source.
