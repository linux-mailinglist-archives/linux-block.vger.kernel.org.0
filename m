I meant non-power_of_2 chunk sectors limit is supported, see

07d098e6bbad ("block: allow 'chunk_sectors' to be non-power-of-2")

And device mapper uses that.

Thanks for the clarification.

Just saw Bart's work on supporting non-power_of_2 zone len:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/dc89c70e-4931-baaf-c450-6801c200c1d7@acm.org/

IMO FS support might be another topic, cause FS isn't the only user,
also without block layer support, the device isn't usable, not mention FS.

Since non-power2 zoned device does exists, I'd suggest Bart to restart the
work and let linux cover more zoned devices(include non-power 2 zone).


Thanks,
Ming
