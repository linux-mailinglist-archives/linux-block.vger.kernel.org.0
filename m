This comment is basically saying the same thing in two different ways.  Could we
just say it once clearly?  Maybe:

/*
 * Return the maximum number of sectors from the start of a bio that may be
 * submitted as a single request to a block device.  The returned value will be
 * a multiple of bio_required_sector_alignment().  If possible, the returned
 * value will also make the request end on a physical block boundary; this
 * minimizes the number of non-aligned requests that are submitted to a block
 * device when a bio doesn't start on a physical block boundary.

'start_offset' and 'pbs_aligned_sector' need to be 'sector_t', not 'unsigned
int'.  Also 'start_offset' probably should be called 'start_sector'.  And
'req_sector_align' could be shortened to just 'align'.
