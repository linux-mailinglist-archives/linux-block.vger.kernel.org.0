I know why it is there, just was saying that having an additional
pointer is fine. But the discussion is moot.

I don't think that you should assume that a blocking driver will block
normally, it will only rarely block (very rarely).

I happen to think it would. Not sure why you resist so much given how
request_queue is arranged currently.

Good, but I'd also won't want to get this without making sure the async
quiesce works well on large number of namespaces (the reason why this
is proposed in the first place). Not sure who is planning to do that...
