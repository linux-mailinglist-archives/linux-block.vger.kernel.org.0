So I was looking into this puzzle. The answer is following:

The process P (podman, pid 2571) is currently attached to the root cgroup
but it has io_context with BFQ queue that points to the already-offline G
as a parent. The bio is thus associated with the root cgroup (via
bio->bi_blkg) but BFQ uses io_context to lookup the BFQ queue where IO
should be queued and then uses its parent to determine blkg which it should
be charged and thus gets to the dying cgroup.

Apparently P got recently moved from G to the root cgroup and there was
reference left in the BFQ queue structure to G.

Yes, it is. But the entity is part of bfq_group structure which is the pd
for the blkcg.

Yes, BFQ queue is removed from the service trees on destruction. But its
parent - bfq_group - is not removed from its service tree. And that's where
we hit the problem.

So bfq_pd_offline() does erase all plain references AFAICT. But later it
can create new plain references (service tree) from the existing "pinned"
ones and once pinned references go away, those created plain references
cause trouble. And the more I'm looking into this the more I'm convinced
bfq_pd_offline() should be more careful and remove also the pinned
references from bfq queues. It actually does it for most queues but it can
currently miss some... I'll look into that.

Thanks for your very good questions and hints!
