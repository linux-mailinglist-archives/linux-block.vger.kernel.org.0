I think that for the first attempt changing will be enough:
-static int fdc;                        /* current fdc */
+static int current_fdc;                        /* current fdc */
and
-#define FD_IOPORT fdc_state[fdc].address
+#define FD_IOPORT fdc_state[current_fdc].address
and for fd_setdor in ./arch/arm/include/asm/floppy.h

This already will require to at least test the building on x86,
arm, sparc arches (maybe more).

Just need to leave a note in the commit why it's not easy to
change FD_IOPORT in this case.

I think that small-step and observable patches are the best option
when we change floppy driver.

As for now, I can see that only floppy.c includes fdreg.h file
with define FDPATCHES. If it's true then #define FD_IOPORT 0x3f0 
branch is never used and we can try to fix remaining FD_* macro
in the next round.
