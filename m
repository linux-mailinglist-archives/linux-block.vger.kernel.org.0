Yeah, the above could work in theory.

Another approach I thought of is to monitor average irq gap time on each
CPU.

We could use EWMA(Exponential Weighted Moving Average) to do it simply,
such as:

	curr_irq_gap(cpu) = current start time of do_IRQ() on 'cpu' -
			end time of last do_IRQ() on 'cpu'
	avg_irq_gap(cpu) = weight_prev * avg_irq_gap(cpu) + weight_curr * curr_irq_gap(cpu) 

	note:
		weight_prev + weight_curr = 1

When avg_irq_gap(cpu) is close to one small enough threshold, we think irq flood is
detected.

'weight_prev' could be chosen as one big enough value for avoiding short-time flood.


Thanks,
Ming
