It seems 16.00.16.00 is even newer than the latest version available on
the Broadcom website, which is a bit strange -- I only found [1] there
which has an older 16.00.14.00 (3008_FW_PH16.00.14.00.rar).

We just realized this is actually the firmware information for a
different unrelated controller on the same host (a LSI MegaRAID SAS-3
3108 using the megaraid_sas driver). But the megaraid_sas one is not
used in our tests, so please ignore the storcli output we provided.
Sorry for the confusion.

The controller we're testing with is the SAS3008 I mentioned initially,
with firmware version 16.00.16.00 as reported by sas3ircu above.

FWIW, the user reports they have also seen the same issue with a
SAS3-9500-8e Tri-mode HBA.

I see, but it is certainly strange that 18T vs 20T drives do seem to
make a difference (hotplug works with 18T and doesn't work with 20T).
