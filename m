IO pause long time if fail over, this is a serios problem. we need fix
it as soon as possible. SRCU is just used for blocking queue,
non blocking queue need 0 bytes. So more bytes(just 24 bytes) is not
waste.

About using per_cpu to replace SRCU, I suggest separate discussion.
Can you show the patch? This will make it easier to discuss.
