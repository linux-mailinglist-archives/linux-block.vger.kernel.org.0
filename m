The document starts with "guidelines for marking intentionally
concurrent normal accesses to shared memory".  The ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE
macros do capture more of the concurrency rules, and perhaps they
could be seen as some kind of "negative marking" where concurrent
access should _not_ happen concurrently with these. But I'm still not
convinced it's the same kind of marking the document introduces.

I always considered them in the realm of general assertions that we
can just use to tell the tool more than can be inferred from the bits
of C code required for the functional implementation of whatever we're
doing.

And I just checked the current access-marking.txt to see where we
might add more, and found the section "ACCESS-DOCUMENTATION OPTIONS"
already exists. I think that section is perfectly reasonable as is,
and it does explicitly talk about ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE* macros.

Did you want to add it more prominently at the top? If so, maybe a
brief forward-reference to that section might be helpful.
