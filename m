Got it, that is exactly the fragile nvme EH handling, and nvme timeout
handling should be fixed instead of error injection code.

The value of fault injection is exactly for finding issue, instead of
avoiding issue, so NAK this patch.

I remember that block/011 of blktests can trigger similar issue too,
unfortunately it is still not fixed after years.


Thanks,
