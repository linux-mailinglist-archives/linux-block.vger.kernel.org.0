Yes, this is necessary. Suppose in the last timer, the iocg doesn't have inflights
and have excess, then iocg->vtime = iocg->done_vtime = (period_at_vtime - margins.target)

Yes, I understand.

Right, the lagging detection is done before the window sliding in this period timer.
The conditions that it checks vtime, done_vtime have been slided in the last timer.

time_after64(vtime, vdone) &&
time_after64(vtime, now.vnow - MAX_LAGGING_PERIODS * period_vtime) &&
time_before64(vdone, now.vnow - period_vtime)

The first condition says it has some inflights, the second condition is always true
if vtime has been slided in the last timer, the third condition will be true if the
cost of io completed since last timer < ioc->margins.target.

So I think it doesn't check correctly whether it has inflights that were issued two+
windows ago.

Thanks.
