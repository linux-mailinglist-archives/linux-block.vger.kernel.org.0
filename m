Awesome.

Good idea, you could modify the SCSI layer (similarly as for NVMe meta) so 
that bio integrity payload data could be packed at the end of a sector for 
drives that have DIF room. This would make it possible to use 520/528-byte 
and 4160/4224-byte-sectored SAS drives in Linux, for the first time ever. 

Newer SAS drives like the Xeos X22 with can support the following sector 
sizes:
	 512 +  0
	 512 +  8
	 512 + 16
	4096 +  0
	4096 + 64
	4096 +128

For now that is fine, we only use enterprise drives anyway, and it will be 
great to use the integrity that the drives support natively. Coupled with 
MDRAID, this solves hidden bitrot quite nicely at that block layer ... and 
it may trickle down into desktop drives eventually.
