oops, you still need iod->op_flags for recognizing the io op, so just
start_sector and nr_sectors can be used.

However, this way isn't good too, cause UBLK_IO_OP_DRV_IN is just mapped
to 'report zone' command in your implementation, what if new pt request
is required in future?

We need to think about how to support ublk pt request in generic way.
