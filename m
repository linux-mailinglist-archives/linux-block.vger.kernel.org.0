Hmm, sorry, but I'm confused.  I'm sure I'm missing something simple,
since I haven't touched this in a while, so maybe you can quickly point
me in the right direction?

I see blk_mq_requeue_request() being used by device drivers to retry
requests that failed, but if I read the code correctly, the flushed
queue seems to be moved to hctx->dispatch when the device
driver returned BLK_STS_RESOURCE or BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE to
blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list(). I thought BLK_STS_RESOURCE was returned by
the driver on .queue_rq() to signal there was no more resources on the
hardware to service further requests.
