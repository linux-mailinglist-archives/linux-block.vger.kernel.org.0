I'm not sure what you're referring to here; could you clarify?

It's true that device-mapper devices don't need the actual keyslot management.
But they do need the ability to expose crypto capabilities as well as a key
eviction function.  And those are currently handled by
"struct blk_keyslot_manager".  Hence the need for a "passthrough keyslot
manager" that does those other things but not the actual keyslot management.

FWIW, I suggested splitting these up, but you disagreed and said you wanted the
crypto capabilities to remain part of the blk_keyslot_manager
(https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-block/20200327170047.GA24682@infradead.org/).
If you've now changed your mind, please be clear about it.
