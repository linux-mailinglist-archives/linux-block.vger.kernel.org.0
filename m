Yes, sure, it's ideal.

This example is about an enumeration. It's, IMO, a very special case
in its own. Two years ago or so, I had proposed to have 'bitwise'
enums where the cast was not needed. In itself is was very easy to do
but there was a lot of subtle issues about type attributes. I think
I've since solved these issues but on the way I've lost my motivation
for these bitwise enums. I'll take a look at it again.

I'm not convinced, for example when thinking about __be{16,32}.
But on the principle, I fully agree: unneeded casts should be avoided.

Yes.

Yes, indeed.
