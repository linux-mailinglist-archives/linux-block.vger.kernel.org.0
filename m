It's a suboptimal solution to the fact that devices were put to market

And please stops bringing up floppy, it's totally irrelevant to this
conversation.

Let's keep this very simple:

1) Have you used the pktcdvd code at all? How much?
2) If yes to the first question, has it been stable?

So bugs in pktcdvd? Or others parts?

I'm saying that you are comparing apples to oranges. The floppy driver
might be older tech, but it's much more used than pktcdvd. It's not the
case that we must pick one over the other, in terms of what stays and
what goes.
