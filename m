No, true, CRD is not directly related to 'command interrupted'.
According to the powers that be CRD evaluation is depending on the ACRE 
setting (and hence should be evaluated whenever a command needs to be 
retried), but 'command interrupted' will only be returned if ACRE is 
enabled.
Consequently, whenever you get a 'command interrupted' you need to check 
the CRD setting to figure out the delay.

Alternatively we can define a new return value, if we shouldn't re-use 
existing ones. Either way I'm fine with.

Ah. Will be modifying the patch then.
