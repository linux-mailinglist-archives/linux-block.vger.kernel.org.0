No no no I'm not! Denis is :-) Really, I mean I just proposed some help
to clean up this mess after being tricked into not believing a bug report
just because the code was too confusing.

I'm not sure what this implies regarding this code, to be honest. It's
very tricky and implements sort of a state machine using function pointers
within its interrupt handler so you never know exactly what accesses what,
and quite a part of it remains obscure to me :-/  I can accept to help, I
can even run tests since I still have running hardware, but I'd at least
need some guidance. And probably Denis would know better than me there.
Also I doubt we'd get sufficient testing on less common archs. While I
do have sparc64/parisc/alpha available, I haven't booted a recent kernel
on any of them for a while (2.4 used to be the last ones), and I'm not
sure it's reasonable to go into such changes without proper testing.

What do you think ?

Willy
