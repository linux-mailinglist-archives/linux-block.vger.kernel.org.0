Hello Ricky,

yes [1] and this issue are the same. As I only have a Surface GO 2
at hand I can not speak for other effected systems, though I guess it is
reasonable that others are effected.
It probably works for some use cases, as it only fails if I read a
lot of files, like opening emacs or firefox ( from the SD Card ). Which then
causes symptoms as outlined
here: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218821

Hello Uffe,
I will try to see what I can do with MMC_CAP_AGGRESSIVE_PM.

All the best,
- Thomas
