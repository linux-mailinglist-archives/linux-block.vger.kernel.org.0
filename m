Oh yeah, I had thought Hou implemented timeout=0 to wait for a reconnect
to handle existing apps. However, I am not sure if they exist. When we
had timeout=0 support the first time then we did not have multi conn and
reconnect support yet.

The current timeout=0 and reconnect support does not work since that is
what Hou is implementing, so we can decide the behavior now.
