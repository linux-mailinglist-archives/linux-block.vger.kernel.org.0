This first i ssue should be fixed with this commit:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=37f0dc2ec78af0c3f35dd05578763de059f6fe77

The commit you found unconditionally sets the discard queue limit to the
reported DMRSL, so it sounds like your target is reporting DMRSL as '0'. Prior
to that commit, we'd use that value only if it was non-zero. I hope that helps.
