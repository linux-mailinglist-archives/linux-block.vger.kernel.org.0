I think the quick fix is to have the device mapper override the default
queue stacking limits to align the dma mask to logical block size.

Does dm-crypt strictly require memory alignment to match the block size,
or is this just the way the current software works that we can change?
It may take me a moment to get to the bottem of that, but after a quick
glance, it looks like dm-crypt will work fine with the 512 offsets if we
happen to have a physically contiguous multi-page bvec, and will fail
otherwise due to a predetermined set of sg segments (looking at
crypt_convert_block_aead()).
