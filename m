Indeed. I do not think that is special to ZNS at all.=0A=

I repeat again here: if you implement zone append emulation, there is no re=
ason=0A=
to reject devices that do not have zone append native support. Zone append=
=0A=
emulation gives you the block device, you can do ioctl(), implement the new=

async passthrough and file systems requiring zone append work too. All prob=
