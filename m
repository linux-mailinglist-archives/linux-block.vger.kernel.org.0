The flush approach did come to mind here as well, but honestly that one is
very ugly and would never have been permitted if it wasn't excluded to be
in the very core code already. But yes, reuse of the existing request is
probably another potentially viable approach. My worry there is that
inevitably you end up needing to stash a lot of data to restore the original,
and we're certainly not adding anything to struct request for that.

Hence I think being able to find a new request reliably would be better.
