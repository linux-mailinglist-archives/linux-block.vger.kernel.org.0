Here's the series. It's not super clean (yet), but basically allows
users like io_uring to setup a bio cache, and pass that in through
iocb->ki_bi_cache. With that, we can recycle them instead of going
through free+alloc continually. If you look at profiles for high iops,
we're spending more time than desired doing just that.

It would not be hard to restrict to same bdev for the cache, just one
more check to do for recycling.

Note that the caching series _only_ supports polled IO for now, as
non-polled would require IRQ juggling for free+alloc and that will
definitely take some of the win away and maybe even render it moot.
Have yet to test that part out. Not a huge deal with the RCU free, as
you end up doing that purely for polled IO and hence wouldn't impact the
IRQ side of things negatively.
