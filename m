In general, since this particular problem is specific to MADV_FREE,
it seemed about right to go for a more contained/particular solution
(than changes with broader impact/risk to things that aren't broken).

This isn't to say either approach shouldn't be pursued, but just that
the larger changes aren't strictly needed to actually fix _this_ issue
(and might complicate landing the fix into the stable/distro kernels.)

Now, specifically on the 2 suggestions you mentioned, I'm not very
familiar with other implementations, thus I can't speak to that, sorry.

However, on the 1st suggestion (set pages dirty early), John noted
[1] there might be issues with that and advised not going there.

Sure.

The test also needs the kernel-side change (to trigger memory reclaim),
which can probably be wired for blktests with a fault-injection capability.

Does that sound good? Maybe there's a better way to do it.

Hmm, checkpatch.pl didn't complain about it. Ah, it checks for 100 chars.
Ok; v4.

Ok; v4.

I'll wait a bit in case more changes are needed, and send v4 w/ the above.

Thanks!
