Your patch changes BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE into BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_ERROR for
regular (no write order preserving) zoned devices. I do not see why this is
needed. The main difference between this default behavior and what you are
trying to do is that BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE is to be expected with your
changes while it is NOT expected to ever happen for a regular coned device.

What error handling ? The only error handling we need is to tell tell the user
that there was an error and track that the user actually does something about
it. That tracking is done with the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag. That's
it, nothing more.

I think that conflating/handling the expected (even if infrequent) write requeue
events with zoned UFS devices with actual hard device write errors (e.g. the
write failed because the device is toast or you hit a bad sector, or you have a
bad cable or whatever other hardware reason for the write to fail) is making a
mess of everything. Treating the requeues like hard errors makes things
complicated, but also wrong because even for zoned UFS devices, we may still get
hard write errors, and treating these in the same way as requeue event is wrong
in my opinion. For hard errors, the write must not be retried and the error
propagated immediately to the issuer (e.g. the FS).

For a requeue event, even though that is signaled initially at the bottom of the
stack by a device unit attention error, there is no reason for us to treat these
events as failed requests in the zone write plugging code. We need to have a
special treatment for these, e.g. a "ZONE_WRITE_NEED_RETRY" request flag (and
that flag can bhe set in the scsi mid-layer before calling into the block layer
requeue.

When the zone write plugging sees this flag, it can:
1) Stop issuing write BIOs since we know they will fail
2) Wait for all requests already issued and in-flight to come back
3) Restoore the zone write plug write pointer position to the lowest sector of
all requests that were requeued
4) Re-issue the requeued writes (after somehow sorting them)
5) Re-start issuing BIOs waiting in the write plug

And any write that is failed due to a hard error will still set the zone write
plug with BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE after aborting all BIOs that are pluggeg
in the zone write plug.

Now, I think that the biggest difficulty of this work is to make sure that a
write that fails with an unaligned write error due to a write requeue event
before it can be clearly differentiated from the same failure without the
requeue event before it. For the former, we can recover. For the latter, it is a
user bug and we must NOT hide it.

Can this be done cleanly ? I am not entirely sure about it because I am still
not 100% clear about the conditions that result in a zoned UFS device failing a
write with unit attention. As far as I can tell, the first write issued when the
device is sleeping will be rejected with that error and must be requeued. But
others write behind this failed write that are already in-flight will endup
failing with an unaligned write error, no ? Or will they be failed with a unit
attention too ? This is all unclear to me.
