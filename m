We would need to know the zone map, which is not otherwise required.
Then we would need to track the write pointer for each open zone for
each queue, so that we can stall writes that are not issued at the write
pointer. This is in effect all zones, because we cannot track when zones
are implicitly closed. Then, if different queues are issuing writes to
the same zone, we need to sync across queues. Userspace may have
synchronization in place to issue writes with multiple threads while
still hitting the write pointer.

It is not good enough to only impose ordering within a zone if we have
requests in flight for that zone. For the first write to a zone when there
are no writes in flight to that zone, we can not know if the write is at
the write pointer, or if more writes to lower LBA is on the way. Not
without tracking the write pointer.

With a sequence number, the sequence number can be queue local. It would
not guarantee that writes always happen at the write pointer, but it
would guarantee that requests are not reordered by ublk_drv, which is
all that is required. As long as userspace is issuing at the write
pointer (as they are required to for zoned storage), this solution would
work, even across multiple queues issuing writes to the same zone.

I would suggest to still use task_work_add() to queue a callback, but
instead of carrying the pdu as the callback argument, use it as a
notification that one or more work items are queued. Then we add the pdu
to a hwctx local FIFO queue.

__ublk_rq_task_work() would then check this FIFO queue and submit all
the requests on the queue to userspace.

Without further optimization __ublk_rq_task_work() would some times be
called with an empty queue, but this should not be too much overhead.
Maybe we could decide to not call task_work_add() if the hwctx local
queue of pdus is not empty.

That is not what I am seeing in practice. I tried looking through
mq-deadline.c, but I could not find code that would order by LBA. Could
you point me to the code that implements this policy?
