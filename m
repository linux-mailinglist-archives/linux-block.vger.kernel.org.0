But in userland, client daemon process and process which send disconnect
command are not same process, so they are not clear to each other, so
client daemon expect driver inform it to exit.
In addition, client daemon will get nbd status with nbd_genl_status interface
after it get notified and it should not re-connect if status connected == 0
