Back to the time 10 years ago when bcache merged into Linux mainline,
checking meta data for a 120G SSD was fast. But now an 8TB SSD is quite
common on server... So the problem appears.

Indeed the bcache registering process cannot be killed, because a mutex
lock (bch_register_lock) is held during all the registration operation.

In my testing, kthread_run()/kthread_create() failure by pending signal
happens after all metadata checking finished, that's 55 minutes later.
No mater the registration successes or fails, the time length is same.

Once the udev timeout killing is useless, why not make the registration
to success ? This is what the patch does.

At this moment, this is a workaround. Christoph Hellwig also suggests to
fix kthread_run()/kthread_create(). Now I am looking for method to
distinct that the parent process is killed by OOM killer and not by
other processes in kthread_run()/kthread_create(), but the solution is
not clear to me yet.

When meta-data size is around 40GB, registering cache device will take
around 55 minutes on my machine for current Linux kernel. I have patch
to reduce the time to around 7~8 minutes but still too long. I may add a
timeout in bcache udev rule for example 10 munites, but when the cache
device get large and large, the timeout will be not enough eventually.

As I mentioned, this is a workaround to fix the problem now. Fixing
kthread_run()/kthread_create() may take longer time for me. If there is
hint to make it, please offer me.

Thanks.
