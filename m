I'm not sure I have got what you really meant.  Please correct me if I'm wrong
here ;)

First of all, removal of variable values in the result of the
discovery get log page
looks great to me also.  Maybe those variable values are able to be replaced
a fixed value like port does (replace port value via sed command to X).

But, it also depends on the outout of the nvme-cli, not return value.
Anyway, let's discuss about it with Keith also because he discussed it with me
few weeks ago,I think.

Agreed.  But, please refer the following comment below ;)

Please refer a discussion on https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli/pull/489
Keith and I had a discussion about the return value of the program itself.
The nvme status value is composed of 16 bits value, by the way, the actual
return value of the program is in 8bits(signed) which means it's not
able to carry
the actual nvme status value out of the program.

If you have any idea about it, Please let me know.  By the way, I really do
agree with what you mentioned about the return value.  If it's possible,
I would like to too :)
