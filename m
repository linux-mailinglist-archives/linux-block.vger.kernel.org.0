Then please use new lock.

You patch 14ef49657ff3 ("block: fix nr_hw_queue update racing with disk addition/removal")
has added one such warning:  blk_mq_sysfs_unregister() is called after
queue freeze lock is grabbed from del_gendisk()

Also there are many such use cases in nvme: blk_mq_quiesce_tagset()/blk_mq_unquiesce_tagset()
called after tagset is frozen.

More serious, driver may grab ->tag_list_lock in error recovery code for
providing forward progress, you have to be careful wrt. using ->tag_list_lock,
for example:

	mutex_lock(->tag_list_lock)
	blk_mq_freeze_queue()		// If IO timeout happens, the driver timeout
								// handler stuck on mutex_lock(->tag_list_lock)


Thanks,
Ming
