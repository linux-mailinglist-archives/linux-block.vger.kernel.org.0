Please see the reason why it is put back of hctx in
073196787727("blk-mq: Reduce blk_mq_hw_ctx size").

Then it may hurt non-blocking.

Each hctx has only one run-work, if the hctx is blocked, no other request
may be queued to hctx any more. That is basically sync run queue, so I
am not sure good enough perf can be expected on blocking.

So it may not be worth of putting the added .dispatch_counter together
with .q_usage_counter.

There are lots of blktest tests doing that, such as block/005,
block/016, block/021, ...
