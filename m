It's all a bit conjecture at this point.
'sdc' could be show up as 'sdd' after the next reboot, with no 
side-effects whatsoever.
At the same time, 'sdc' could have been blocked by a host of reasons, 
none of which are related to the additional device being exported.

It doesn't really look like an issue with device naming; you would need 
to do proper investigation on your server to figure out why I/O stopped.
Device renaming is typically the least likely cause here.
