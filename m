I don't have any data on that, unfortunately. All I can say that we have se=
en
filesystem corruption when installing Linux inside an LDOM and this particu=
lar
issue was eventually tracked down to this commit.

I would assume that this would require for the virtual disk server to not
respond which should never happen since it's a virtualized environment.

If hardware issues would cause vio_ldc_send() to never succeed, these would
have to be handled by the virtualization environment, I guess.

I generally agree with this remark. I just wonder whether this behavior sho=
uld
apply for a logical domain as well. I guess if a request doesn't succeed im=
mediately,
it's an urgent problem if the logical domain locks up, is it?

I have to admit though that I'm absolutely not an expert on the block layer=
.

We could add this particular change on top of mine after we have extensivel=
y tested it.

For now, I would propose to pick up my patch to revert the previous change.=
 I can then
pick up your proposed change and deploy it for extensive testing and see if=
 it has any
side effects.
