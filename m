It's right queue can be active while there is no io, blk_mq_tag_idle()
will not be called untill such queue doesn't issue any io for a period
time, thus I do think io will not hung eventually, however, it can be
improved that io will rely on other devices to woke up.

BTW, I tried to improve that tags can be wasted for share tags long time
ago:
