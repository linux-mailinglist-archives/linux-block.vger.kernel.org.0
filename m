It depends if nvme error handling needs to cover new coming NS,
suppose it doesn't care, and you can change to srcu and bypass
->tag_list_lock.

It can be done easily by tag_set->srcu.

->tag_list_lock isn't involved.

There is also add/del disk vs. updating nr_hw_queues, do you want to
add the per-set lock in add/del disk path too?

Actually freeze lock is already held for nvme before calling
blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues, and it is reasonable to suppose queue
frozen for updating nr_hw_queues, so the above order may not match
with the existed code.

Do we need to consider nvme or blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues now?

I understand that the per-set elevator_lock is just for avoiding the
nested elvevator lock class acquire? If we needn't to consider nvme
or blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues(), this per-set lock may not be needed.

It is actually easy to sync elevator store vs. update nr_hw_queues.

Yes, reordering ->freeze_lock and ->elevator_lock may avoid many fs_reclaim
related splat.

However, in del_gendisk(), freeze_lock is still held before calling
elevator_exit() and blk_unregister_queue(), and looks not easy to reorder.
