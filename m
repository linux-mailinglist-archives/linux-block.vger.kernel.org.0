Hi Hannes,

Please take another look at patches 04/16 and 05/16. As one can see no
LBA numbers are being compared in the SCSI core - comparing LBA numbers
happens in the sd (SCSI disk) driver. The code that you replied to
compares ULD pointers, a well-defined concept in the SCSI core.

Your request to move the functionality from patches 04/16 and 05/16 into
the block layer would involve the following:
* Report the unaligned write errors (because a write did not happen at the
   write pointer) to the block layer (BLK_STS_WP_MISMATCH?).
* Introduce a mechanism in the block layer for postponing error handling
   until all outstanding commands have failed. The approach from the SCSI
   core (tracking the number of failed and the number of busy commands
   and only waking up the error handler after these counters are equal)
   would be unacceptable because of the runtime overhead this mechanism
   would introduce in the block layer hot path. Additionally, I strongly
   doubt that it is possible to introduce any mechanism for postponing
   error handling in the block layer without introducing additional
   overhead in the hot path.
* Christoph's opinion is that NVMe software should use zone append
   (REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND) instead of regular writes (REQ_OP_WRITE) when
   writing to a zoned namespace. So the SCSI subsystem would be the only
   user of the new mechanism introduced in the block layer. The reason we
   chose REQ_OP_WRITE for zoned UFS devices is because the SCSI standard
   does not support a zone append command and introducing a zone append
   command in the SCSI standards is not something that can be realized in
   time for the first generation of zoned UFS devices.

Because I assume that both Jens and Christoph disagree strongly with your
request: I have no plans to move the code for sorting zoned writes into
the block layer core.

Jens and Christoph, please correct me if I misunderstood something.

Thanks,

Bart.
