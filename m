I don't think this code is buggy.  The mapping may not be the mapping
you would expect, but it is the mapping that md/raid0 had always used up
to this time.

This is buggy because, as you say, the third argument to map_sector has
changed.
Previously it was bio->bi_iter.bi_sector.  Now it is 'sector' which
find_zone has just modified.

There are four separate cases that we need to consider:
 - v1.x metadata
 - v0.90 metadata
 - LVM metadata (via dm-raid)
 - no metadata (array created with "mdadm --build").

For v1.x metadata, I think we can add a new "feature_map" flag.
If this flag isn't set, raid0 with non-uniform device sizes will not be
assembled.
If it is set, then:
  if 'layout' is 0, use the old mapping
  if 'layout' is 1, use the new mapping

For v0.90 metadata we don't have feature-flags.  We could
The gvalid_words field is unused and always set to zero.
So we could start storing some feature bits there.

For LVM/dm-raid, I suspect it doesn't support varying
sized devices, but we would need to check.

For "no metadata" arrays ... we could possibly just stop supporting
them - I doubt they are used much.

Once this is decided, we then need to work out how to
make it all usable via mdadm.

mdadm needs to set the relevant flags and 'layout' values
when creating an array, and it needs to be able to set them correctly
on an existing array that doesn't have them set.

We also need to decide what happens when a new mdadm is run on an old
kernel.
If we create an array with a new feature bit, the old kernel won't
be able to assemble it.  But if we don't set the feature bit, then
the array will not assemble after an upgrade.

It might be easier to think about this when we actually have concrete
code, but if anyone does have useful input, I'd be very happy to read
it.
