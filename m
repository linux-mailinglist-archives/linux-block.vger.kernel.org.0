Given that this is a kernel bug and can be exploited by any user-space
application, the fix in the kernel is a must have. But we don't want
to break any existing user-space applications. So, we do need to go
make sure that this patch doesn't break any existing applications. I
originally sent this patch assuming that blktrace is the only user of
this IOCTL. So, if anyone knows any other callers that we need to
investigate, please let me know. I have verified that these limits
don't break blktrace.

From what I understand, there's no alternative to having a fix in the
kernel. That's because, if the kernel is not fixed and only the
commonly used user-space apps are fixed, I can always write a new
program to break the kernel. So, as mentioned above, maybe we can make
these limits configurable via sysfs but we'll need these bound checks
in the kernel.

Thanks,
