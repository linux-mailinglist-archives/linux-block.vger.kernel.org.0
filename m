Hi Bart.

The proposed patch is not realy aimed at RAID1.

Creating a new dm device in the non-FMODE_EXCL mode and then remaping bio
requests from the regular block device to the new DM device using
the blk_interposer will allow to use device mapper for regular devices.
For dm-linear, there is not much benefit from using blk_interposer.
This is a good and illustrative example. Later, using blk-interposer,
it will be possible to connect the dm-cache "on the fly" without having
to reboot and/or reconfigure.
My intention is to let users use dm-snap to create snapshots of any device.
blk-interposer will allow to add new features to Device Mapper.

As per Daniel's advice I want to add a documentation, I'm working on it now.
The documentation will also contain a description of new features that
blk_interposer will add to Device Mapper

Thanks.
