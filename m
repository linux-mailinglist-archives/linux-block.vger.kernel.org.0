Right, but that doesn't really solve the problem when the rust bindings
get in the way of changes that you are currently making. Or if you break
them inadvertently. I do see benefits to that approach, but it's no
panacea.

This seems to assume that time is plentiful and we can just add more to
our plate, which isn't always true. While I'd love to do more rust and
get more familiar with it, the time still has to be there for that. I'm
actually typing this on a laptop with a rust gpu driver :-)

And this isn't just on me, there are other regular contributors and
reviewers that would need to be onboard with this.

That is certainly a win!

Each case is different though, different people and different schedules
and priorities. So while the above is promising, it's also just
annecdotal and doesn't necessarily apply to our case.
