I'm having problems to understand how a guest can attach a large number
of block devices without those having been configured by the host admin
before.

If those devices have been configured, dom0 should be ready for that
number of devices, e.g. by having enough spare memory area for ballooned
pages.

So either I'm missing something here or your reasoning for the need of
the patch is wrong.
