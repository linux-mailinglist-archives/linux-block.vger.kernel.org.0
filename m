The original plan wasn't to develop bdev async writes as a separate
useful feature, but rather to do it as a first step to both become
acquainted with the code base and solve some of the common issues for
both.

The fact that we need to touch buffer_heads for the bdev path is
annoying, and something that I'd very much rather just avoid. And
converting bdev to iomap first is a waste of time, exactly because it's
not a separately useful feature.

Hence I think we'll change gears here and start with iomap and XFS
instead.

That would indeed be great, and to be honest, the current code for bdev
read/write doesn't make much sense outside of from a historical point of
view.
