Thanks for this overview. Should help level-set others.

Adding fallocate support has been a long-standing dm-thin TODO item
for me. I just never got around to it. So thanks to Sarthak, you and
anyone else who had a hand in developing this.

I had a look at the DM thin implementation and it looks pretty simple
(doesn't require a thin-metadata change, etc).  I'll look closer at
the broader implementation (block, etc) but I'm encouraged by what I'm
seeing.

Mike
