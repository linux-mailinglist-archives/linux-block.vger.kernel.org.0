Maybe the word of 'RT case' isn't accurate, I thought isolated CPUs is only
used for realtime cases, at least that is Peter's usage, maybe I was
wrong.

But it can be generic for all isolated CPUs cases, in which users
don't want managed interrupts to disturb the isolated CPU cores.

As mentioned above, it can be applied for all isolated CPUs, when users
don't want managed interrupts to disturb these CPU cores.

OK, will do that in formal post.
