Drat. Thanks for testing.

Yes, patch 4 should be handling this.

Maybe I'm missing something so let's walk through your example where the
bio is submitted for a task attached to q3. Bio is submitted,
__bfq_bic_change_cgroup() is called with sync_bfqq == q3, the loop

               while (sync_bfqq->new_bfqq)
                       sync_bfqq = sync_bfqq->new_bfqq;

won't do anything. Then we check:

               if (sync_bfqq->entity.sched_data != &bfqg->sched_data) {

This should be true because the task got moved and the bio is thus now
submitted for a different cgroup. Then we get to the condition:

                       if (orig_bfqq != sync_bfqq || bfq_bfqq_coop(sync_bfqq))

orig_bfqq == sync_bfqq so that won't help but the idea was that
bfq_bfqq_coop() would trigger in this case so we detach the process from q3
(through bic_set_bfqq(bic, NULL, 1)) and create new queue in the right
cgroup. Eventually, all the processes would detach from q3 and it would get
destroyed. So why do you think this scheme will not work?

And even if q3 is not marked as coop (which should not happen when there
are other queues merged to it), we would move q3 to a cgroup for which IO
is submitted - i.e., a one which is alive.

Hum, but maybe with the above merge setup (q1->q2->q3) if
__bfq_bic_change_cgroup() gets called for q1, q3 is already moved to the root
cgroup by bfq_pd_offline() and bio is for the root cgroup, then we decide
to keep everything as is. But bfq_setup_cooperator() will return q2 and
we queue IO there and q2 may still be pointing to a dead cgroup (but q2
didn't get reparented because it was not in any of the service trees). So
perhaps attached fixup will help?
