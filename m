At least my idea would not be to disallow LOOP_CLR_FD on a used block
devices as that would go back to the udev problems before Dave turned
it into a magic LO_AUTOCLEAR.  But to remove the lo_refcnt check
entirely, as loop_clr_fd now is safe against concurrent users - it
has to anyway as there can be other users even without an open.
