SO I had a look and there isn't anything easier than adding the proposed
NULL check in generic_make_request_checks().  Given the many
conditionals in that  function.. what's one more? ;)

I looked at marking the queue frozen to prevent IO via
blk_queue_enter()'s existing cheeck -- but that quickly felt like an
abuse, especially in that there isn't a queue unfreeze for bio-based.

Jens, I'll defer to you to judge this patch further.  If you're OK with
it: cool.  If not, I'm open to suggestions for how to proceed.
