read() actually returns 0 because of the following code in blkdev_read_iter():

        if (pos >= size)
                return 0;

IMO, if loop is detached, any IO should have been failed. However,
read/flush is just a bit special:

- blkdev_read_iter() always return 0 if the read is beyond the device
size(0)

- submit_bio(FLUSH) return successfully if the queue doesn't support
writeback cache.

OK, looks it is fine to disable writeback cache in __loop_clr_fd().

BTW, just wondering why don't you disable WC unconditionally in
__loop_clr_fd() or clear it in the following way because WC can be
changed via sysfs?

	if (test_bit(QUEUE_FLAG_WC, &q->queue_flags))
		blk_queue_write_cache(q, false, false);

Thanks,
