More generally speaking, I think we really should have a single dispatch list:
the scheduling policy (per prio with aging, and either lba or fifo ordered)
decides on what request should be sent by adding them to the dispatch list. If
we reschedule again requests that are in the dispatch list, we end up with a
very complicated and hard to debug scheduling policy. Kaitao's patch is proof of
that...

And for the at-head requests, it is indeed debatable what to do. We could be a
little intelligent about them and do a sorted insert in the dispatch list based
on the requests priorities so that we do not have priority inversions. But that
feels like an optimization. I think that the most common case for at-head
insertion is (rare) requeue, no ? Have not checked.

So I feel like Kaitao's problem can be fixed exactly like you said: use a single
dispatch queue and drop the started_after() check in __dd_dispatch_request() for
the dispatch queue.
