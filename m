The logic isn't perfect. The idea is that you only care about this
metric when the device under some constant load. For spinning disks,
it's calculated by contributing the average latency of an interval
cur_win_nsec's long to an exponential moving average. See
iolat_update_total_lat_avg().

Yeah so I can't remember if this change preceeded the other change, but
timing is now calculated based on issue time which comes the time marked
before it enters the block layer. This means it includes any delays that
have been incurred. But from the output, you can see that you're at
depth=1 and use_delay=12 meaning it is in play iirc.

To get the value you're looking for, we'd have to plumb through
rq->io_start_time_ns. There is an inherent mismatch here as
blk-iolatency works at the bio layer and not the request layer.

However, blk-iolatency is meant to protect a single cgroup from the
system. In this case, it seems like given your workload, workload + the
workload on the system is saturating the disk. Meaningfully, someone
else is throttling you as their iolatency is being violated. I'd
consider switching to iocost for a proportional io controller.
