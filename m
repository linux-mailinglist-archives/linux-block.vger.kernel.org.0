Hi Eric,

This is much better than the magic numbers to control io prio.

I am not familiar with cgroup configuration and implementation, I just
wondering because most of I/Os in bcache are done by kworker or kthread,
is it possible to do per-process control.

Anyway, we may start from the bypass stuffs in your example. If you may
help to compose patches and maintain them in long term, I am glad to
take them in.

Thanks.
