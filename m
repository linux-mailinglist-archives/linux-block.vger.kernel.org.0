I think it is safe to not check it in blk_drop_partitions(), how about
the following patch?

Subject: [PATCH] block: always remove partitions in blk_drop_partitions()

So far blk_drop_partitions() only removes partitions when
disk_part_scan_enabled() return true. This way can make ghost partition on
loop device after changing/clearing FD in case that PARTSCAN is disabled.

Fix this issue by always removing partitions in blk_drop_partitions(), and
this way is correct because:

1) only loop, mmc and GENHD_FL_HIDDEN disks(nvme multipath) may set
GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN

2) GENHD_FL_HIDDEN disks doesn't expose disk to block device fs, and
bdev_disk_changed()/blk_drop_partitions() won't be called for this kind of
disk

3) for mmc, if GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN is set, no any partitions can be added
for this kind of disk, so blk_drop_partitions() basically does nothing no
matter if GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN is set or not because disk_max_parts(disk) <= 1

4) for loop, bdev_disk_changed() is called in two cases: one is set fd and set
status, when there shouldn't be any partitions; another is clearing/changing fd,
we need to remove old partitions and re-read new partitions if there are and
PART_SCAN is enabled.
