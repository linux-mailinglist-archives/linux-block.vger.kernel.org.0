Maybe not. Most of the configuration fields have already been
validated at the virtio level.

The guest memory is encrypted, the host can not read or write any
guest memory not explicitly shared with it. In this case, the guest
doesn't trust the host. There are already some efforts [1] [2] to
protect this kind of guest from untrusted devices.

I'm not sure if there will be some ways to leak data in an encrypted
VM with the invalid block size.
