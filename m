So this gets to the meta question that is giving me pause on this
whole proposal:

    What does Linux get from merging mpool?

What you have above is a decent scalability bug report. That type of
pressure to meet new workload needs is how Linux interfaces evolve.
However, rather than evolve those interfaces mpool is a revolutionary
replacement that leaves the bugs intact for everyone that does not
switch over to mpool.

Consider io_uring as an example where the kernel resisted trends
towards userspace I/O engines and instead evolved a solution that
maintained kernel control while also achieving similar performance
levels.

The exercise is useful to identify places where Linux has
deficiencies, but wholesale replacing an entire I/O submission model
is a direction that leaves the old apis to rot.
