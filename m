So, do you see a path where we enable the following:

    1. We add the emulation layer to the NVMe driver for enabling FSs
       that currently support zoned devices
    2. We add a path from user-space (e.g., uring) to enable passthru
       commands to the NVMe driver to enable a raw ZNS path from the
       application. This path does not require the device to support
       append. An initial limitation is that I/Os must be of < 127 bio
       segments (same as append) to avod bio splits
    3. As per above, the NVMe driver allows ZNS drives without append
       support to be initialized and the check moves to the FS
       formatting.

2 and 3. is something we have on our end. We need to rebase on top of
the patches you guys submitted. 1. is something we can help with after
that.

Does the above make sense to you?

Agree.
