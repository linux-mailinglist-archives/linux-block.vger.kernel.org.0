Yeah, this is a little odd.

This history is: we know we need to merge the scsi fc transport and the 
nvme fc transport as the two independent things are creating 
difficulties and duplications (devloss is an example). But it's a bit of 
work to change this as it will move where the objects are in the 
topology tree.

As we tried to figure out how to do the interaction with cgroups, we 
wanted to support SCSI and nvme. If you look at how this new attribute 
sets the vmid, it's somewhat generic - it just sets the fc appid field 
on a cgrp id.  There's really nothing that says the cgrp is on a block 
device that is scsi or is nvme.  It should work on devices regardless of 
their underlying protocol type. Which then left the question - where to 
place such an attribute.

Given this is an "fc service" and as we knew the transport will be 
merged eventually we picked to put it under /sys/class/fc point which is 
where we expect to root the common transport. This class point happens 
to be owned/created by the nvme fc host code for requesting nve-fc 
rediscovery events. It is odd that it creates a requirement to load the 
nvme-fc transport in order to set values for scsi fc devices, but we 
deemed it acceptable.  Guess we need to get going on that merged 
transport...
