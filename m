Ah now I follow, so you're still terminating it, just one before
overflow rather than letting it overflow. Yes I agree that makes more
sense! It could still terminate early though, if the application reaps
CQEs before another one is posted. So I think the opportunistic early
termination is probably best ignored.

Or the app could always be using the full size of the CQ ring, and never
above. With the change, it'd still terminate every CQ-ring-size
requests, even though it need not.

IOW, I think we just leave it as-is, no? Neither of these should cause
an app issue, as CQE_F_MORE is the one driving terminations. But you
could have more unneeded terminations, even if that may be far fetched.
Though you never know, an opportunistically terminating with a known
racy check seems like something we should not do.

Misunderstanding, I thought you'd still post with CQE_F_MORE and need to
restart it. But that wasn't the case.

Yep fully agree, I think it was largely a talking past each other on
exactly what it'd do.

Agree, any time a test needs changing, it should be cause for extra
thinking in terms of whether this will have application impacts as well.
In general, the tests are overly anal, and sometimes they do end up
testing implementation details. The API is pretty clear in this regard,
if you see CQE_F_MORE, then you get more completions. If you don't, the
request has terminated. The change doesn't really impact that.
