Sorry, I should have attached test results here. Initially I tried to use
tcmu user:fbo backstore to evaluate performance improvements, but
it only shows about 10%~15% io throughput improvement. Fio config
is numjobs=1, iodepth=8, bs=256k, which isn't very impressive. The
reason is that user:fbo backstore does buffered reads, it consumes most
of cpu.

Then I test this zero copy feature for our real workload, whose backstore
is a network program visiting distributed file system and it's 
multi-threaded.
For 4 job, 8 depth, 256 kb io size, the write throughput improves from
3.6GB/s to 10GB/s.

Xiaoguang Wang
