Yes, it will work to disable this capability for MD and DM.

But if/when a stacked device _dooes_ want to support this then it'll be
awkward to override this stacking default to allow blk_stack_limits()
to properly stack up this limit.  blk_limits are extremely fiddley so
this isn't necessarily new.  But by explicitly defaulting to 0 and then
having blk_stack_limits use min() for this limit: it results in stacking
drivers needing to clumsily unwind the default.  E.g. DM will need to
tweak its blk_stack_limits() related code to allow override that
actually _does_  stack up the underlying devices' capability (and not
just impose its own limit that ignores the underlying devices).

So I'm not convinced this is the right way to go (be it the v4 approach
you took or the cleaner use of blk_set_stacking_limits I suggested).

And to be clear, I'm interested in having DM thinp support this
capability to preallocate blocks.

Mike
