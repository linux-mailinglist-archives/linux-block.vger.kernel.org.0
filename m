Firstly too much((nr_hw_queues - 1) times) memory is wasted. Secondly IO
latency could be increased by too deep scheduler queue depth. Finally CPU
could be wasted in the retrying of running busy hw queue.

Wrt. driver tags, this patch may be worse, given the average limit for
each LUN is reduced by (nr_hw_queues) times, see hctx_may_queue().

Another change is bt_wait_ptr(). Before your patches, there is single
.wait_index, now the number of .wait_index is changed to nr_hw_queues.

Also the run queue number is increased a lot in SCSI's IO completion, see
scsi_end_request().

Kashyap Desai has performance benchmark on fast megaraid SSD, and you can
ask him to provide performance data for this patches.

Thanks,
Ming
