As Nikolay writes in the other thread, I too have a feeling that there
have been a discard-related discussion at LSF/MM before. And if I
remember, there were hints that the drives (sometimes) do asynchronous
trim after returning a success. Which would explain the similar time
for all sizes and IO drop after trim.

So, I think that the mixed workload (IO + discard) is a pretty
important part of the whole topic and a pure discard test doesn't
really tell us anything, at least for some drives.
