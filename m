I guess the serialization is what my nesting meant:

1) code path1:

- quiesce
- do something
- unquiesce

2) code path2:
- quiesce
- do something
- unquiesce

What the patch tries to implement is that the actual unquiesce action has
to be done in the last or outermost unquiesce of the two code paths.

Not sure if serialization is a good term here, maybe I should use words of
concurrent quiesce, or other better one? Nesting is really supported
by this patch, such as code path2 may be part of 'do something' in code
path1. Meantime serialization among quiesce and unquiesce is supported
too.

running hw queue in each unquiesce doesn't matter, what matters is that
the QUIESCE flag has to be cleared in the outermost or the last unquiesce.
But if QUIESCE isn't set, it isn't useless to run hw queue in unquiesce.

 

Thanks,
Ming
