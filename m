Yes, indeed, for SCSI, CDL descriptors are defined in mode pages.

All of them (see patch 8). For the ATA devices, the mode sense translation can
only report support for T2A/T2B (see patch 17).

Note that the kernel does not handle directly the CDL descriptor mode pages.
These need to be set by the user using passthrough tools such as sg3utils or
cdl-tools.
