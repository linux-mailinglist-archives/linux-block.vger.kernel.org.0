Javier, Igor,
you are correct. The problem exists if we have a power loss and we
have an open gc and an open user line and both contain the same LBA.
In that case, I think we need to care about the 4 scenarios:

1. user_seq_id > gc_seq_id and user_write after gc_write: No issue
2. user_seq_id > gc_seq_id and gc_write > user_write: Cannot happen,
open user lines are not gc'ed
3. gc_seq_id > user_seq_id and user_write after gc_write: RACE
4. gc_seq_id > user_seq_id and gc_write after user_write: No issue

To address 3.) we can do the following:
Whenever a gc line is opened, determine all open user lines and store
them in a field of pblk_line. When choosing a victim for GC, ignore
those lines.

Let me know if that sounds good and I will send a v2
Heiner
