Hi Jens,

Thanks for the reply.
For the use case of the additional stats, as a cloud provider, we
often need to handle report from the customers regarding
performance problem in a period of time in the past, so it's not
feasible for us to run blktrace, customer workload could change from
time to time, with the additional stats, we gather through all metrics
using Prometheus, we can navigate to the period of time interested,
to check if the performance matches the SLA, it also helps us to find
the user IO pattern,  we can more easily reproduce.

We do use blktrace from time to time too if it's not too late (when IO
pattern has not changed.)

Thanks!
Jack
