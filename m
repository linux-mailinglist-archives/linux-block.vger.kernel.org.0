Subject: [PATCH BUGFIX/IMPROVEMENT V2 2/6] block, bfq: put reqs of waker and woken in dispatch list

Consider a new I/O request that arrives for a bfq_queue bfqq. If, when
this happens, the only active bfq_queues are bfqq and either its waker
bfq_queue or one of its woken bfq_queues, then there is no point in
queueing this new I/O request in bfqq for service. In fact, the
in-service queue and bfqq agree on serving this new I/O request as
soon as possible. So this commit puts this new I/O request directly
into the dispatch list.

+	 * Reqs with at_head or passthrough flags set are to be put

+	 * directly into the dispatch queue: the only active
+	 * bfq_queues are bfqq and either its waker bfq_queue or one
+	 * of its woken bfq_queues. The rationale behind this
+	 * additional condition is as follows:
+	 * - consider a bfq_queue, say Q1, detected as a waker of
+	 *   another bfq_queue, say Q2
+	 * - by definition of a waker, Q1 blocks the I/O of Q2, i.e.,
+	 *   some I/O of Q1 needs to be completed for new I/O of Q2
+	 *   to arrive.  A notable example of waker is journald
+	 * - so, Q1 and Q2 are in any respect the queues of two
+	 *   cooperating processes (or of two cooperating sets of
+	 *   processes): the goal of Q1's I/O is doing what needs to
+	 *   be done so that new Q2's I/O can finally be
+	 *   issued. Therefore, if the service of Q1's I/O is delayed,
+	 *   then Q2's I/O is delayed too.  Conversely, if Q2's I/O is
+	 *   delayed, the goal of Q1's I/O is hindered.
+	 * - as a consequence, if some I/O of Q1/Q2 arrives while
+	 *   Q2/Q1 is the only queue in service, there is absolutely
+	 *   no point in delaying the service of such an I/O. The
+	 *   only possible result is a throughput loss
+	 * - so, when the above condition holds, the best option is to
+	 *   have the new I/O dispatched as soon as possible
+	 * - the most effective and efficient way to attain the above
+	 *   goal is to put the new I/O directly in the dispatch
+	 *   list
+	 * - as an additional restriction, Q1 and Q2 must be the only
+	 *   busy queues for this commit to put the I/O of Q2/Q1 in
+	 *   the dispatch list.  This is necessary, because, if also
+	 *   other queues are waiting for service, then putting new
+	 *   I/O directly in the dispatch list may evidently cause a
+	 *   violation of service guarantees for the other queues
