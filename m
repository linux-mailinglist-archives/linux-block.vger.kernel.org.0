Got it (and my memories of struct request lifetime rules had been stale,

You mean, try and put together a commit message for that one-liner? ;-)

[PATCH] blk_add_rq_to_plug(): 'last' is stale after flush, if we end up doing one

blk_mq_flush_plug_list() empties ->mq_list and request we'd peeked there
before that call is gone; in any case, we are not dealing with a mix
of requests for different queues now - there's no requests left in the
plug.
