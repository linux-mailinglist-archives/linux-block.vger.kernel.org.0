Basically zero cost is added to hot path, exactly:

> +	if (unlikely(direct_issue && rq->mq_ctx->cpu != raw_smp_processor_id()))

In case of direct issue, chance of the io process migration is very
small, since basically direct issue follows request allocation and the
time is quite small, so smp_mb() won't be run most of times.

So barrier() is added most of times, however the effect can be ignored
since it is just a compiler barrier.

hctx->state is always checked in hot path, so basically zero cost.

Why do we want to fix CPU migration of direct issue IO process? It may not be
necessary or quite difficultly:

1) preempt disable is removed previously in cleanup patch since request
is allocated

2) we have drivers which may set BLOCKING, so .queue_rq() may sleep

Not sure why you mention queue freezing.
