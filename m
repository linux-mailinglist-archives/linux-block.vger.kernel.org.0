Oh, bio_integrity_add_page uses bvec_try_merge_hw_page.  That means it
doesn't really work well for our stacking model, as any stacking driver
can and will change these.  Maybe we need to take a step back and fully
apply the immutable biovec and split at final submission model to
metadata?

Where common case is the somewhat awful auto PI in the lowest level
driver.  I'd really much prefer to move to the file system adding
the PI wherever possible, as that way it can actually look into it
(and return it to the driver, etc).

Yes.  Plus dm-integrity and the new io_uring read/write with PI code
that's being submitted. I plan to also support this from the file
system eventually.  None of these seems widely used, which I think
explains the current messy state of PI as soon as merging/splitting
or remapping is involved.
