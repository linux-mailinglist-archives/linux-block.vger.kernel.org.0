I think that Bo's use-case is an example of a major upstream Linux host
that is struggling with unmmapped LBAs. Can we focus on this use-case
and the parts that we are missing to support Bytedance?

If you agree to this, I believe we can add support for ZoneFS pretty
easily. We also have a POC in btrfs that we will follow on. For the time
being, F2FS would fail at mkfs time if zone size is not a PO2.

What do you think?
