The initial patch has 5 as the default, and there are no sysfs knobs. If
you ever need a sysfs knob, by all means make it a variable and make it
configurable too. But don't do it upfront where the '5' suitabled named
would do the job.

Just put it higher up if you want, it doesn't really matter, or leave it
where it is.

I would do something similar to my change and drop the 'dc' addition for
the max retries as it, by definition, can only be one value right now.
For all I know, you'll never need to change it again, and then you're
just wasting memory and making the code harder to read by putting it in
dc instead of just having this define.
