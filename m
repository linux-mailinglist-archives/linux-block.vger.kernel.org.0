To elaborate a bit: the reason this seems strange to me is that when people say
they need a 128-bit (or larger) non-cryptographic hash function, usually they
are either mistaken and 64-bit would suffice, or they actually need a
cryptographic hash function.

In this case, the hash function seems to be used for data deduplication.  This
is unusual, since data deduplication normally requires a cryptographic hash
algorithm.

I see that this is touched on by the following paragraph in vdo-design.rst
(though it incorrectly calls the hash an "identifier for the block"):

    Each block of data is hashed to produce a 16-byte block name which serves as
    an identifier for the block. An index record consists of this block name
    paired with the presumed location of that data on the underlying storage.
    However, it is not possible to guarantee that the index is accurate. Most
    often, this occurs because it is too costly to update the index when a block
    is over-written or discarded. Doing so would require either storing the
    block name along with the blocks, which is difficult to do efficiently in
    block-based storage, or reading and rehashing each block before overwriting
    it. Inaccuracy can also result from a hash collision where two different
    blocks have the same name. In practice, this is extremely unlikely, but
    because vdo does not use a cryptographic hash, a malicious workload can be
    constructed. Because of these inaccuracies, vdo treats the locations in the
    index as hints, and reads each indicated block to verify that it is indeed a
    duplicate before sharing the existing block with a new one.

So, dm-vdo handles hash collisions by reading back and verifying that the data
matches before allowing deduplication.

That solves the security problem.  However, it does seem strange, and it's more
complex than the usual solution of just using a cryptographic hash.  Note that
cryptographic hashing is very fast on modern CPUs with modern algorithms.

So, some more details about the rationale for designing the data deduplication
in this (IMO unusual) way should be included.
