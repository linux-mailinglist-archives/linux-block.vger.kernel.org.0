It is _not_ related with WBT or write cache.

When your monitor sends SIGKILL, do_exit() is actually called, but
io_uring_cancel_generic() blocks on io_wq_put_and_exit() because STOP_DEV
can't be completed, then do_exit() can't move on, and finally the ublk cancel
function can't be called, then ublk char device can't be closed.

Looks something which might be improved in future, but it highly depends on
(complicated) io_uring's cancel code path, and I believe there isn't
any way for ublk to get notified when do_exit() happens from `kill -9`.

So far there are at least two ways:

1) don't provide signal handler for SIGINT, or simply call exit() in the
signal handler, and ublk block device is removed automatically when ublk
server is done in case of !USER_RECOVERY.

OR

2) provide signal SIGINT handler to stop device, meantime not send SIGKILL
in your monitor process. This way works just fine if your ublk server is
well implemented, which often requires you to handle timeout in the server
implementation.
