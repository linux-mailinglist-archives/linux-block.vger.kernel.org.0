How can it be ancient technology when CD-, DVD- and Blueray-writers are being sold by the thousands at this very moment? Floppy disk drives on the other hand
were invented in 1967. This is the ancient technology you're looking for.

Yes, I've written the the code myself, thank you. It's prototype hardware and it's not intended as an open source software project. It is therefore not going to
be released to the general public. When it's finished, and it isn't at the moment, it's hopefully going to be part of your future processors.

I did however find a enormous lot of bugs (in the kernel, the compiler, and in latex) since the project start, that deserve the attention of the opensource
community. The bugs will come available to you in time. We can work on a better kernel and compiler together.

Who are you talking about? Are you asking to be removed? I'm afraid I don't quite understand.

Mischa.
