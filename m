Thread B is holding budget and hasn't released it yet, right?  In the
context of scsi, that means "device_busy >= 1", right?  So how can the
code you point at help us?  When Thread C reads "device_busy" it will
be 1 and that code won't run.  What did I miss?

...what function would you like me to call to check?  The code you
wrote in response to v2 only checked work for the given "hctx".  What
about other "hctx" that are part of the same "queue".  Are we
guaranteed that has_work() returns the same value for all "hctx"s on
the same "queue"?  If so, why doesn't has_work() take the "queue" as a
parameter?
