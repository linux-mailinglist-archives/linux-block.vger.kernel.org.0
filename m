I cannot really comment on the bcache part because I am not familiar
with the code. It is quite surprising to see an initialization taking
that long though.

Anyway

this sounds like a wrong way to address the issue. Killing the udev
worker is a userspace policy and the kernel shouldn't simply ignore it.
Is there any problem to simply increase the timeout on the system which
uses a large bcache?

Btw. Oleg, I have noticed quite a lot of flush_signals usage in the
drivers land and I have really hard time to understand their purpose.
What is the actual valid usage of this function? Should we somehow
document it?
