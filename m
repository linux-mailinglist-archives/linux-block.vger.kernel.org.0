 i10 demonstrates the core tradeoff: higher latency, but also higher throug=

the batching size. The new results (https://github.com/i10-kernel/upstream-=

es performance for low loads, while keeping the performance for high loads.=
 IMO, there is much to do on designing improved adaptation algorithms.

ompared to noop, but still requires more work for lower loads. However, giv=
en that the tradeoff exposed by i10 scheduler is particularly useful for re=
mote storage devices (and as Jens suggested, perhaps for virtualized local =
storage access), I do agree with Sagi -- I think we should consider includi=
ng it in the core, since this may be useful for a broad range of new use ca=
ses.
