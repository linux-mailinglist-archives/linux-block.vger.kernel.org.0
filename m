zonefs *was* design from the start as a file-based raw access method so
that zoned block devices can be used from applications coded in
languages such as Java, which do not really have a direct equivalent of
ioctl(), as far as I know.

So no, it is not an accident and did not "end up that way". See:

Documentation/filesystems/zonefs.rst

If anything, where zonefs currently falls short is the need to do direct
IO for writes to sequential zones. That does not play well with
languages like Java which do not have O_DIRECT and also have the super
annoying property of *not* aligning IO memory buffers to sectors/pages
(e.g. Java always has that crazy 16B offset because it adds its own
buffer management struct at the beginning of a buffer). But I have a
couple of ideas to solve this.

If you see problems with it, please report them. We have Hadoop/HDFS
running with it and it works great.With zonefs, any application
chuncking its data using files over a regular FS can be more easily
converted to using zoned storage with a low overhead FS. Think Ceph as
another potential candidate.

And yes, it is not a magical solution, since in the end, it exposes the
device as-is.

No. btrfs already has provision for unavailable blocks in a block group.
