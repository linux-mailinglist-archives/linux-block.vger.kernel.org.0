I am not sure I understand your point. Those lower layers always were
able to get at least one request per request_queue. They can do whatever
they want with it after that. This change removes that guarantee for
blk-mq in some cases, right? I just don't think you can readily conclude
that is "safe" by appealing to the legacy behavior, that's all.
