Looks you are talking about AIO. IMO, if AIO is used in Changheun's
test, the UFS controller pipeline can be saturated easily by many
enough(> 8 or more) 32M requests(preparing each takes 2ms, and device need
16ms to handle 32MB req), then there shouldn't be such issue.

So I guess Changheun uses sync dio, and the 2ms preparing time is added
to bio submission delay every time.

Changheun, can you talk about your 32MB block size direct IO test in a
bit detail? AIO or sync dio? Do you have fio command line to reproduce
this issue?
