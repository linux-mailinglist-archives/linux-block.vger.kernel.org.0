This sounds very typical of a low end consumer grade NVMe SSD, yes.

If you want to disable the cache (despite this being unsafe!) you can
do this for every block device:

	echo "write through" > /sys/block/XXX/queue/write_cache

It is, but in that case the disk will not advertise a write cache, and
the flushes will not make it past the submit_bio and never reach the
driver.

cat /sys/block/XXX/queue/write_cache
