The implementation has morphed given multipage bvecs and iov_iters, but
otherwise it looks structurally much the same as the version I
originally introduced.

Please attribute correctly, and that would've included CCing me on the
patch that dropped the EXPORT_SYMBOL().

So, you "told" the person that originally authored not only this code
but all our modern bio splitting infastructure that this isn't the way
to go?

That's quite the way of framing it.

The way you're doing it with bdev_logical_block_size() is just wrong -
even for single device filesystems! - because it's the filesystem
blocksize that's relevant here and that isn't necessarily going to match
(even if it matched when the filesystem was formatted, filesystems can
be moved to different block devices).

You'll figure this out sooner or later as bs > ps becomes more
prevalent...
