Indeed. The issue is that dropping that also does not allow the
association of extra custom higher number loop block nodes created manually
even if you *do* load a respective module before use. That is by design
by the commit, since we're stuffing the nasty old probe logic now under the new
CONFIG_BLOCK_LEGACY_AUTOLOAD. Subtle difference, but same deprecation
effect.

I agree with the approach to stuff all this nasty cruft under
BLOCK_LEGACY_AUTOLOAD however I suspect v5.19 might be too soon to tell if we
can nuke it safely by then though.

I'd go so far as to say that we should sadly make
BLOCK_LEGACY_AUTOLOAD=y for a while before going with an axe to kill it.
I think we have a few hidden gems we'll soon discover might need a bit
more time to adjust.

FWIW below is a simple test, which now fails to explain what I mean with
the above.

root@kdevops ~ # cat loop-high-devs.sh 
#!/bin/bash

NUM="8"
LOOPDEV="/dev/loop${NUM}"

modprobe loop
sleep 2

if [[ ! -e $LOOPDEV ]]; then
	mknod $LOOPDEV b 7 $NUM
fi

losetup -d $LOOPDEV 2>/dev/null

DISK="test_loop_${NUM}.img"
rm -f $DISK
truncate -s 10M $DISK
losetup $LOOPDEV $DISK
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "$LOOPDEV ready"
else
	echo "$LOOPDEV failed"
fi
