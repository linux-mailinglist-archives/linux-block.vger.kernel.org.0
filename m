Hello,

Here is the second version, then.  But, instead of
blk_mq_request_started as suggested on the review, this uses
blk_mq_rq_state to access the state attribute, since we don't want to
include MQ_RQ_COMPLETE.

Also, improved the commit message a bit.

Thanks,

According to Documentation/block/stat.rst, inflight should not include
I/O requests that are in the queue but not yet dispatched to the device,
but blk-mq identifies as inflight any request that has a tag allocated,
which, for queues without elevator, happens at request allocation time
and before it is queued in the ctx (default case in blk_mq_submit_bio).

In addition, current behavior is different for queues with elevator from
queues without it, since for the former the driver tag is allocated at
dispatch time.  A more precise approach would be to only consider
requests with state MQ_RQ_IN_FLIGHT.

This effectively reverts commit 6131837b1de6 ("blk-mq: count allocated
but not started requests in iostats inflight") to consolidate blk-mq
behavior with itself (elevator case) and with original documentation,
but it differs from the behavior used by the legacy path.
