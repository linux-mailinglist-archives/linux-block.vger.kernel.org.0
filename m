AFAIK the patch you reference changes NOUNMAP requests to use
FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE and is queued for 5.5, which means patch #2 will
clash with it.  It sort of looks like patch #2 reimplements the patch
that Jens already pulled for 5.5, so you probably want to rebase this
series atop his for-next tree.... but you should really ask Jens.
