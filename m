Yes, I see that now, thanks for the explanation and forgive me that I'm
not that familiar with vfs code. :(

Now I think the patch can actually fix the problem, blkdev_open() and
blkdev_release() is not affected, and O_EXCL is not used from
bdev_file_open_by_dev() before. This is not straightforward, however I
can't find a better solution myself, so feel free to add:
