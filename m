If the original commit is a fix and the fix for it is being squashed,
then Reported-by might mislead.

kbuild-bot tests also patches from list directly, so in such case the
patch can be re-done with a risk of loosing kbuild's credits. But when
the patch is already in the maintainer tree - just create a fixup. You
preserve the development history and the kbuild's credits.
