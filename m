OK. Got it. Thanks for clarifying.

And that would be to retain the older (broken) behavior. Because if we
consider the man page, tasks with an unset IO prio should be reported as
having the effective IO nice based priority, which is class BE if IO nice
is not set. Right ? I am OK with that, but I think we should add this
explanation as a comment somewhere in the prio code. No ?

Indeed.
