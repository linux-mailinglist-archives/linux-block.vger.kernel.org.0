It can be workaround this way, or return NULL if the hctx becomes
inactive.

But there is big problem to dispatch such request to inactive hctx, as
I explained.

The patch I posted can be applied to non-reserved tag too, and the connect
request can figured by rq->private_rq_data simply.

Also, we can provide blk_mq_rq_is_reserved() helper if you think 'rq->tag =
=3D=3D 0'
is like a hack.

There are several solutions for this:

1) schedule the connection on selected CPUs, so that all hw queues can be
covered

2) use single tag_set for connect command only.
