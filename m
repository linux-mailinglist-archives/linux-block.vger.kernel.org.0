Yes, can change that.

I wanted to avoid the multiplication in the rather common
for_each_rinfo() usage.

rinfo and idx are simple variables, so I don't think they need
parentheses. info maybe. But just seeing it now: naming the
parameter "rinfo" and trying to access info->rinfo isn't a good
idea. It is working only as I always use "rinfo" as the pointer.

See "the inline disease" in the kernel's coding style.
