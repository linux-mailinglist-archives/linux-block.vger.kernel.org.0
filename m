A very basic question:

The virtio_blk driver has no q->mq_ops->timeout() callback. Why does the
block layer still enable the timeout mechanism when the driver doesn't
implement ->timeout()?

I saw there was some "idle" hctx logic and I guess the requests are
resubmitted (although it wasn't obvious to me how that happens in the
code)? Maybe that's why the timer is still used if the driver doesn't
care about timeouts...
