rpmlint spotted that the LGPL v2.1 license file is outdated so I've
replaced it with the latest one from
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt.

The Free Software Foundation address is outdated in COPYING and the file
still mentions LGPL v2 where the latest text mentions v2.1:

     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
+    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

I'm not sure if the v2 vs v2.1 issue matters to the copyright holders of
liburing.  The reason I am posting this patch is to make rpmlint happy
but we could leave the file unchanged if you prefer.
