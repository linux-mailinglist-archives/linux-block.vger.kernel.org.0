You may misunderstand the concern, it isn't for solving load balancing,
it is just for making zero copy easier to use.

Not like other uring_cmd(FETCH, COMMIT_AND_FETCH), register io buffer is
for target IO handling, which shouldn't be limited in the ubq_daemon
context, Uday did mention this point in above link.

I do agree load balancing should be addressed, together with relaxing
existing ublk server context limitation.

Uday's patch can be one good start from both driver and selftest code
side.

However, spread load in static way may not solve this problem completely,
which may be one transitional solution, IMO, but it is fine to move on
with it when comments are addressed.

We should support dynamic load balancing by allowing to migrate IO to
other context runtime in future:

- it should be enough to add one per-io spin lock in driver side, there
  isn't contention for good ublk implementation

	https://github.com/ming1/linux/commits/ublk_task_neutral/

- when load isn't balanced or some task contexts are saturated, IO need to
migrate to other task contexts

- IO migration should just happen when load isn't balanced, and it won't be
needed when load becomes balanced, so cross-CPU isn't one thing

- the migration logic need to be triggered from target code, but the
  mechanism can be implemented in library

Almost all Uday's selftest code can be reused for above, especially the
nice ublk_thread abstraction, maybe it can be named as ublk_task_ctx, then
ring_buf & eventfd & read_mshot notification can be added to it for
supporting IO migration.


Thanks,
Ming
