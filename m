Okay, thanks for clarifying.

It looks like we have a couple of options to support this. I suggest
we consider the two below, but perhaps others (Arnd/Linus?) have
better ideas?

1)
Model the power on/off of the silicon around the crypto HW through a
phy provider driver. The phy provider should then manage the "ice"
clock and the SMC call, through the ->power_on|off() callbacks, while
the mmc driver would act as the consumer of the phy. This would be
rather straightforward to implement, but I guess it can be debated if
this fits as a phy or not.

2)
Another slightly more complicated solution, would be to manage the SMC
call and the "ice" clock through a PM domain (aka genpd provider). As
a matter of fact, we already have a couple of references that use the
genpd infracture like this, as it allows devices to be turned on/off
from SoC specific code, through runtime PM. I wouldn't mind giving you
more pointers to examples for inspirations, if this is the option we
decide to go for.

Kind regards
Uffe
