This reads a bit funny, did you want to put the blk_mq_ctx thing after
the "software staging queues"? Right now it looks like the requests are
of that type, which of course isn't true.

I'd say "one or more BIOs", as there can be just one.

NOOP is a relic from the single queue days, the basic "doesn't do much"
scheduler is NONE these days. And it doesn't provide FIFO ordering,
requests will basically just end up in whatever software queue the
process is running on. When someone runs the hardware queue, the
software queues mapped to that hardware queue will be drained in
sequence according to their mapping (generally from 0..N, if 0..N are
mapped to that hardware queue).
