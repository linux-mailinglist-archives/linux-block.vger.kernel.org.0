Seems we were lucky so far to only hit this with FAT.

I also tried couple variations of reproducer:

- Disabling udevd and running just "blkid --probe" in parallel
  also reproduced it
- Disabling udevd and running read() on first 1024 sectors in parallel
  also reproduced it
- aio_read() submitted prior to mount could reproduce it,
  as long as fd was held open
- I couldn't reproduce it with fadvise/madvise WILLNEED submitted prior to mount

https://systemd.io/BLOCK_DEVICE_LOCKING.html mentions flock(LOCK_EX) as a way
to avoid probing while "another program concurrently modifies a superblock or
partition table". Adding flock(LOCK_EX) works around the problem too, but that
would address problem only for LTP (and tools/scripts that use this approach).

I ran reproducer on patched kernel for 5 hours, it made over 25000 iterations,
there was no corruption. Thank you for looking at this.
