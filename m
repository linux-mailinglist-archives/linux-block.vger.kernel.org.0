Hard no on supporting these. See below.

No, there is no support for "marking" zones offline (or read only): trans=
itions
into these states are not explicit due to any command execution, but dete=
rmined
by the drive, and asynchronous as far as the host is concerned. There is =
support
for *detecting* offline zones though, so that FSes do not attempt to use =
these
dead zones. But that is more part of error processing than the regular IO=
 path
because seeing offline zones is not expected, but rather, the result of a=
 drive
going bad. HMSMR would essentially allow users to explicitly offline zone=
s,
wreaking the IO path and potentially generating lots of IO errors.

So HSMR support should only be allowed (if it ever is) to be controlled b=
y a
file system, not by the user. And if the user wants to do raw block devic=
e IOs,
then it can use passthrough commands to control the activation state of z=
ones.

Writes to CMR zones on regular host-managed SMR can straddle CMR zone bou=
ndaries
too (but not CMR-to-SMR boundary). We do not allow it because micro optim=
izing
for this case is not worth the overhead it introduces. So hard no on this=
.

Passthrough commands. There are no kernel internal users of this, so I do=
 not
see any need to add an interface for activate/deactivate zones. libzbc v6=
 is
coming soon with an API for zone domains/zone realms commands (already av=
ailable
with the zone-domains branch of the source code).

There is no implicit zone management commands issued by the kernel, excep=
t the
one report zones done on disk scan/revalidate. Any zone management comman=
d is
explicit, asked for by the user or FS using the drive. So that is up to t=
he user
to limit these to control the overhead.

In general, support for hybrid SMR (Zone domains / zone realms) is a hard=
 no
from me. This feature set is a total nightmare to deal with in the kernel=
. It
opens a ton of corner cases that will require lots of checks in the hot p=
ath. We
definitely do not want that.
