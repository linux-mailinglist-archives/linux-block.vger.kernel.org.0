If you kill the NBD server then the config is going to be dropped and need to be 
reconfigured, so nbd_config_put() will definitely be called.  The only case it 
wouldn't be is if you are using the netlink interface, in which case the device 
is going to keep all of its original settings.  Are you not seeing the final 
nbd_config_put() being done when you kill the nbd server?  That seems like a bug 
if not, and that should be fixed, and then this timeout thing going in there 
will fix your issue.  Thanks,

Josef
