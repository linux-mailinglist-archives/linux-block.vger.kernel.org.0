Well, not sure if that's required.

Or, to be correct, we actually have _two_ use-cases:
1) Have a SMR drive as a backing device. This was my primary goal for
handling these devices, as SMR device are typically not _that_ fast.
(Damien once proudly reported getting the incredible speed of 1 IOPS :-)
So having bcache running on top of those will be a clear win.
But in this scenario the cache device will be a normal device (typically
an SSD), and we shouldn't need much modification here.
In fact, a good testcase would be the btrfs patches which got posted
earlier this week. With them you should be able to create a btrfs
filesystem on the SMR drive, and use an SSD as a cache device.
Getting this scenario to run would indeed be my primary goal, and I
guess your patches should be more or less sufficient for that.
2) Using a SMR drive as a _cache_ device. This seems to be contrary to
the above statement of SMR drive not being fast, but then the NVMe WG is
working on a similar mechanism for flash devices called 'ZNS' (zoned
namespaces). And for those it really would make sense to have bcache
being able to handle zoned devices as a cache device.
But this is to my understanding really in the early stages, with no real
hardware being available. Damien might disagree, though :-)
And the implementation is still on the works on the linux side, so it's
more of a long-term goal.

But the first use-case is definitely something we should be looking at;
SMR drives are available _and_ with large capacity, so any speedup there
would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Hannes
