Mike, keep in mind that when bio_rewind() was originally introduced, it
immediately grew users that were _inherently buggy_ (of the "users can break
this trivially") variety, and the whole thing had to be reverted, and I was
really annoyed - mostly at myself, because I would have caught it if I'd been
paying attention to the mailing list more.

And I _guarantee_ you that if this makes it in, we'll have the same thing
happening all over again - we have a lot of different block drivers being
written by a lot of different people, and most of them do not understand all the
subtleties of the block layer and the ways different things can interact, and so
the onus is on us to not add tools that they aren't going to immediately turn
around and slice themselves with.

The 32 bytes you're trying to save is meaningless. Think instead about the weeks
of engineer time that get wasted by bugs like this - chasing the bugs,
babysitting the patches in to fix it, then the _endless_ -stable backports.

_Please_ try to think more defensively when you're writing code.

So, and I'm sorry I have to be the killjoy here, but hard NACK on this patchset.
Hard, hard NACK.

I'll be happy to assist in coming up with alternate, less dangerous solutions
though (and I think introducing a real bio_iter is overdue, so that's probably
the first thing we should look at).

Cheers
