ATA doesn't really have autosense in the SCSI way.  It could be handled
the same way that CDL completions are handled.  That is a complete
mess, and between CDL and Zone Append we'll probably eventually need
an extended FIS for SATA if we want to keep ATA alive.

Time to get it started then!

Because that's the only thing that actually works.

If you have something magic that works, this code is the place to take
advantage of it.
