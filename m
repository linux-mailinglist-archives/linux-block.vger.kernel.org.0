This is all about removing modules, not about "driver removal" from a
device.  Please make the subject line here more explicit.

Can you duplicate this in a real-world situation?

What tools remove the zram module from the system on the fly?

As fun as this is, it's not a real workload, please do not pretend that
it is.

And your code is still racy, see below.  You just made the window even
smaller, which you still should be objecting to as you somehow feel this
is a valid usecase :)

You can not increment/decrement your own module's reference count and
expect it to work properly, as it is still a race.
