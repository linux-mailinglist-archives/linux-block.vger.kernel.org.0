Ah now I remember - so it's not that it _needs_ to be 32-byte aligned,
it's just a handy way to ensure that it doesn't straddle two cachelines.
In fact, there's no real alignment concern, outside of performance
reasons we don't want it touching two cachelines.

So... what exactly is your concern? Just silencing that warning? Because
there doesn't seem to be an issue with just having it wherever in struct
request.
