Hmm, BTW, if optimization is further advanced, it is possible that
the loop start position is not always at the beginning of the function.
It is easy to provide --skip-prologue to perf probe but it doesn't
ensure that works always as you expected.

For example,

func()
{
1:
	{ /* block which doesn't executed in tail-recursion call */
	...
	}
2:
	{ /* block which always executed in tail-recursion call */
	...
	}
	func()
}

In this case, it is natural that the optimizer put a jump to 2 instead
of 1. Moreover, if the number of recursion is fixed, the optimizer
can unroll the loop. In that case there are no jumps. 

So, as Steve pointed, strictly speaking, the developer needs to understand
what the source code was compiled into, before tracing/debuging it.

For the perf-probe case, I'm now thinking it is better user to
choose the line in the function explicitly. I wish I had another flag
that there was a tail-recursion, then I can warn users...

Thank you,
