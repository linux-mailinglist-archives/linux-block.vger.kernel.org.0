I don't think you're appreciating the complications that active-active
and multi-host brings to the scenario. Those are why this is not the
forum to solve it. The specs need to be clear on the guarantees, and
what they currently guarnatee might provide some overlap with what
you're seeking in specific scenarios, but I really think (and I believe
Martin agrees) your use is outside its targeted use case.

In this specific regard, I think its safe to assume the devices will
remain operational.

As I mentioned, READ FUA provides an optimization opportunity that
can be used instead of Write + Flush or WriteFUA when the host isn't
sure about the persistence needs at the time of the initial Write: it
can be used as a checkpoint on a specific block range that you may have
written and overwritten. This kind of "read" command provides a well
defined persistence barrier. Thinking of Read FUA as a barrier is better
aligned with how the standards and device makers intended it to be used.

So you're telling me you've never written SSD firmware then waited for
the manufacturer to release it to your users? Yes, I jest, and maybe
YMMV; but relying on that process is putting your destiny in the wrong
hands.
