Hi,

This patchset cleans up a number of issues and pain points
I've had with getting the nvme blktests to pass and run cleanly.

The first three patches are meant to fix the Generation Counter
issue that's been discussed before but hasn't been fixed in months.
I primarily use a slightly fixed up patch posted by Michael Moese[1]
but add another patch to properly test the Generation Counter that
would no longer be tested otherwise.

I've also taken it a step further to filter out more of the discovery
information so that we are less fragile against churn and less dependant
on the version of nvme-cli in use. This should also fix the issue discussed
in [2].

Patches 4 through 7 fix a number of smaller issues I've found with
individual tests.

Patches 8 through 10 implement a system to ensure the nvme tests
clean themselves up properly especially when ctrl-c is used to
interrupt a test (working with the tests before this was a huge
pain seeing,  when you ctrl-c, you have to either manually clean
up the nvmet configuration or reboot to get the system in a state
where it's sane to run the tests again).

Patches 11 and 12 make some minor changes that allow running the
tests with the nvme modules built into the kernel.

With these patches, plus a couple I've sent to the nvme list for the
kernel, I can consistently pass the entire nvme suite with the
exception of the lockdep false-positive with nvme/012 that still
seems to be in a bit of contention[3].

Thanks,

Logan
