Yes. It seems like it will pick the maximum, which is 11s?

I see.

I have digested the information you provided in these emails. Let me
summarize it, to see if I have understood correctly.

1.
Your controller can't distinguish between R1 and R1B because of a
limitation in the HW. So, in both cases you need to wait for the card
to stop signal busy, before the controller can give an IRQ to notify
that the R1 response has been received. Correct?

In this context, I am wondering if sdhci_send_command(), really
conforms to these requirements. For example, depending on if the CMD6
has MMC_RSP_BUSY or not, it may pick either SDHCI_CMD_RESP_SHORT or
SDHCI_CMD_RESP_SHORT_BUSY.

Does this work as expected for your case?

2.
Assuming my interpretation of the above is somewhat correct. Then you
always need to set a busy timeout for R1/R1B responses in the
controller. The maximum timeout seems to be 11s long. Obviously, this
isn't enough for all cases, such as cache flushing and erase, for
example. So, what can we do to support a longer timeouts than 11s?
Would it be possible to disable the HW timeout, if the requested
timeout is longer than 11s and use a SW timeout instead?

Kind regards
Uffe
