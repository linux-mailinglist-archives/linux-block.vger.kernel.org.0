That doesn't make any difference for current uses, but we may extend it
to support debugfs for non-blk request queue in future by exporting q->id
somewhere. Even though now the interested q->id can be figured out
easily by very simple ebpf trace prog.

First it needs more change to fix the kernel panic.

Second removing debugfs dir in del_gendisk will break blktests block/002.

Finally this patch's approach is more flexible, since it provides chance to
export debugfs for request queue without disk attached, such as scsi queue
without disk attached, nvme admin queue, ...
