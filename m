OK, thanks.

Please note that I still want to check further whether some of Ming's 
series "blk-mq: implement queue quiesce via percpu_ref for 
BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING" can be used.

Understood. I need to check your concern further to allay any fears.

So I could probably change that patch to drop the early return.

Instead we just need to ensure that we complete any existing calls to 
blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() prior to freeing the IO scheduler requests. 
Then we don't need to return early and can iter as before - but, as I 
said previously, there should be no active tags to iter.

No, we need them all in some form.

So far, reports are that 1/3 solves the most common seen UAF. It is 
pretty easy to trigger.

But the scenarios associated with 2/3 and 3/3 are much harder to 
trigger, and I needed to add delays in the code just to trigger them.

Thanks,
John
