I'm not arguing mq design over-architecture for simple devices. It is a
given that if one doesn't need some of those things surely they can
create a minor delta loss in performance. I'm asking and suggesting that
despite a few workloads being affected with a *minor delta* for brd for mq
conversion if the huge gains possible on some *other* workloads suffice for
it to be converted over.

We're talking about + ~125% performance boost benefit for randreads.
