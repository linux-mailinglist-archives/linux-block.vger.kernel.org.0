Not really. I think that Benjamin has a very valid point here.
Image target 1 mapping an entire SMR HDD with MOZ1=128 max open limit and target
2 being one zone of another drive with MOZ2=whatever max open zones limit.
For such mapped device, the user can simultaneously write at most 128 zones and
these zones can be:
1) all in target 1 -> then the mapped device max open zone limit of 1 is silly.
128 would work just fine.
2) 127 zones in target 1 and the 1 zone of target 2: then again the mapped
device max open zone limit of 1 is overkill and 128 limit is still OK.

Now if MOZ2 is say 16 and we map more than 16 zones from target 2, THEN we need
to cap the mapped device max open zone limit to 16 as we can potentially have
the user trying to simultaneously write more than 16 zones belonging to target 2.

So the cap on the number of zones of the target I have is not correct. What I
need to not blindly do a min_not_zero() of the limits and look at the number of
zones being mapped. That is, something like:

	if (target_nr_zones > target_moz)
		moz = target_moz;
	else
		moz = 0;
	mapped_dev_moz = min_not_zero(mapped_dev_moz, moz);

And same for max active limit. And we still need a cap of the limits on the
number of zones mapped at the end, when setting the mapped device limits.

Let me cook a V2 of this patch, with *lots* of comments to clarify this.

Note: I am also writing some blktests cases to test all this. I will add more
setups with challenges like this to ensure that the right limits are set.
