attempt_merge() is always called so that 'req' is always the request with
the lower sector, 'next' is the request with a higher sector, and 'next' is
discarded and 'req' is updated. So attempt_merge() always performs only one
direction of a merge and I don't think it makes any sence to distinguish
back merges and forward merges in this case. So discards don't need any
special treatment either AFAICT.
