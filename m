It is because two corner cases are handled in other ways:

    Now that we have the patches ("blk-mq: In blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list()
    "no budget" is a reason to kick") and ("blk-mq: Rerun dispatching in
    the case of budget contention") we should no longer need the fix in
    the SCSI code.  Revert it, resolving conflicts with other patches that
    have touched this code.

It is still not straightforward enough or simple enough for proving its
correctness, even though the implementation isn't complicated.

You are right, it is correct to just run this hctx.

Your patch for delay running hw queue causes delay once one request
is completed, and the queue should have been run immediately after one
request is finished.

Yeah, we all think that way is correct thing to do, and now the problem
is how to run hw queue just in case of budget contention.
