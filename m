There might be at least two reasons:

1) when .bio_merge() is called, some requests are kept in plug list, so
the bio may not be merged to requests in scheduler queue; when flushing plug
list and inserts these requests to scheduler queue, we have to try to
merge them further

2) only blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge() is capable of doing aggressive
request merge, such as, when req A is merged to req B, the function will
continue to try to merge req B with other in-queue requests, until no
any further merge can't be done; neither blk_mq_sched_try_merge() nor
blk_attempt_plug_merge can do such aggressive request merge.



Thanks,
Ming
