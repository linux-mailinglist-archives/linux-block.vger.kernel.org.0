One other observation. This line right here is suspicious.
What I expect to see here is something like this:

Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on "/dev/vda2" or unknown-block(254,2) ]---

IOW, the name of the device that failed to mount should be printed.
Since that doesn't show up this indicates that the kernel booted here
didn't have commit 84d2b696236c ("init/mount: print pretty name of root
device when panics") which I've merged for v6.7.

So that output looks like it's from a pre v6.7 kernel. But Jan's write
restriction changes only made it into v6.8. So even if the patches
somehow were to apply to this kernel they'd be entirely ineffective
since CONFIG_BLK_DEV_WRITE_MOUNTED is not available in this kernel.
