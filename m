This approach looks good, and very neat thanks per-vq lock.

BTW, is there any virt-exit saved by disabling vq interrupt? I understand
there isn't since virt-exit may only be involved in remote completion
via sending IPI.

You mean the hardware need to consider order between DMA completion and
interrupt notify? But it is disabling notify, guest just calls
virtqueue_get_buf() to see if there is buffer available, if not, it will be
polled again.

4 jobs can consume up all 4 vCPUs. Just run a quick fio test with
'ioengine=io_uring --numjobs=1' on single vq, and IOPS can be improved
by ~20%(hipri=1 vs hipri=0) with the 3 patches, and the virtio-blk is
still backed on NVMe SSD.


Thanks,
