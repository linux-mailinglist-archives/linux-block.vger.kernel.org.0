Yes, exactly. It'd be great if non-polled requests don't get added to the
ctx->iopoll_list in the first place.

IO_URING_F_IOPOLL, while named in an enum that sounds suspiciouly like it is
part of ioucmd->flags, is actually ctx flags, so a little confusing. And we
need to be a litle careful here: the existing ioucmd->flags is used with uapi
flags.
