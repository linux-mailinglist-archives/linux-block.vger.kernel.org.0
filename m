How about like this?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Linux kernel provides the following access-marking options:

1.	Plain C-language accesses (unmarked), for example, "a = b;"

2.	Data-race marking, for example, "data_race(a = b);"

3.	READ_ONCE(), for example, "a = READ_ONCE(b);"
	The various forms of atomic_read() also fit in here.

4.	WRITE_ONCE(), for example, "WRITE_ONCE(a, b);"
	The various forms of atomic_set() also fit in here.

5.	__data_racy, for example "int __data_racy a;"

6.	KCSAN's negative-marking assertions, ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS()
	and ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER(), are desccribed in the
	"ACCESS-DOCUMENTATION OPTIONS" section below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Would that work?

							Thanx, Paul
