Hi Damien,

As you know the Kyber I/O scheduler dispatch callback only returns requests
for the hardware queue that has been passed as an argument to the dispatch
callback. So it's probably safe to set the
ELEVATOR_FLAG_SUPPORTS_ZONED_WRITE_PIPELINING for the Kyber I/O scheduler.
However, that hasn't been done yet.

Since neither Kyber nor BFQ set the flag
ELEVATOR_FLAG_SUPPORTS_ZONED_WRITE_PIPELINING, zoned write pipelining will
be left disabled for these I/O schedulers. See also the following code from
a previous patch:

+bool blk_pipeline_zwr(struct request_queue *q)
+{
+	return q->limits.features & BLK_FEAT_ORDERED_HWQ &&
+	       (!q->elevator ||
+		test_bit(ELEVATOR_FLAG_SUPPORTS_ZONED_WRITE_PIPELINING,
+			 &q->elevator->flags));
+}

I don't think that the race described above can be solved in the block layer.
More in detail, the race condition that I observed several times while running
tests with mq-deadline and zoned write pipelining enabled and without the
mq-deadline patches from this series is as follows:

CPU core a                                  CPU core b
------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------
blk_mq_run_hw_queue(hctx c)                 blk_mq_run_hw_queue(hctx c)
   blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests(hctx c)      blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests(hctx c)
     blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched(hctx c)            blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched(hctx c)
       dd_dispatch_request(hctx c) -> rq e
                                                   dd_dispatch_request(hctx c) -> rq f
       blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list(hctx c)             blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list(hctx c)
                                                     q->mq_ops->queue_rq(hctx c, rq f)
         q->mq_ops->queue_rq(hctx c, rq e)

If requests (e) and (f) refer to the same zone, with write pipelining enabled,
the above sequence causes request reordering. If both requests are regular
writes (not write appends), this will trigger an UNALIGNED WRITE COMMAND error.
I think this can only be solved by modifying an I/O scheduler such that its
dispatch callback only dispatches requests for the hctx that has been passed as
an argument to the dispatch function.

Please note that for my use cases I'm fine with not using any I/O scheduler at
all and hence that I'm fine with dropping the mq-deadline patches from this
series. Is this perhaps what you prefer?

Thanks,

Bart.
