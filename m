Hi Ming,

My idea was to split the control and dataplanes in different file
descriptors.

A queue has a fd that is mapped to a shared memory area where the
request descriptors are.  Submission/completion are done by read/writing
the index of the request on the shared memory area.

For the data plane, each request descriptor in the queue has an
associated file descriptor to be used for data transfer, which is
preallocated at queue creation time.  I'm mapping the bio linearly, from
offset 0, on these descriptors on .queue_rq().  Userspace operates on
these data file descriptors with regular RW syscalls, direct splice to
another fd or pipe, or mmap it to move data around. The data is
available on that fd until IO is completed through the queue fd.  After
an operation is completed, the fds are reused for the next IO on that
queue position.

Hannes has pointed out the issues with fd limits. :)

I implemented it as a block-mq driver, but it still only supports one
queue.
