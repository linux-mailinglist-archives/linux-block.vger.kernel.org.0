Oh, yes, it's my fault, I just simulated it in my head, thank you for pointing out.
I think I'd add an [RFC PATCH] next time. 

For this issue, I have two solutions, first is this, just avoid passing DRAIN and LINK at
the same time; second is allow, let the SQE following LINK inherit the DRAIN flag, but
It's more complicated, I prefer the first one.

I will rewrite this patch later, with a real test. Thanks again.
