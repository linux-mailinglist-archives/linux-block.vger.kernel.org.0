It might be not a usual setup, but it is a nice possibility that you get with
MD. If for the moment you don't have drives of the needed size, but have
smaller drives. E.g.:

- had a 2x1TB RAID1;
- one disk fails;
- no 1TB disks at hand;
- but lots of 500GB disks;
- let's make a 2x500GB RAID0 and have that stand in for the missing 1TB
member for the time being;

Or here's for a detailed rationale of a more permanent scenario:
