I'm unconvinced that creating an initramfs is any harder than building your own
kernel with this patch and providing the configuration information to the
device, especially for android where we inside of Facebook provision android
devices with a custom initramfs all the time, and have done so for many, many
years.

There is no "standard NBD handshake protocol" is my point.  That part exists
outside of the NBD spec that the kernel is concerned with.  The client is happy
to do whatever it pleases.  Now there's no doubt that the standard nbd client
and server that is shipped is the reference spec, but my point is that it is
still outside the kernel and so able to change as it sees fit.

...I am the maintainer, but feel free to try to get Jens to take a patch that I
think is unnecessary.  Thanks,

Josef
