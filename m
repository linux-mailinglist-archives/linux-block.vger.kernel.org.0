I assume you tested this?  IIRC there was a problem where 0 really meant 0 and
commands would insta-timeout.  But my memory is foggy here, so I'm not sure if
it was setting the tag_set timeout to 0 that made things go wrong, or what.  Or
I could be making it all up, who knows.

There's a blktest that just runs fio on a normal device with no timeouts or
anything, that's where I would see the problem since it was a little racy.
Basically have the timeout set to 0 and put load on the disk and eventually
you'd start seeing timeouts.  If that all goes fine then you can add
