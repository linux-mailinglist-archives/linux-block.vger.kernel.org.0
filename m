We still may shutdown blktrace if current is the last opener, otherwise
new blktrace can't be started and memory should be leaked forever, and
what do you think of the revised version?

Subject: [PATCH] block: shutdown blktrace in case of task exiting

blktrace may allocate lots of memory, if the process is terminated
by user or OOM, we need to provide one chance to remove the trace
buffer, otherwise memory leak may be caused. Also new blktrace
instance can't be started too.

Fix the issue by shutdown blktrace in case of task exiting in
blkdev_close() when it is the last opener.
