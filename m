Mike,

there was nothing personal in my reply - sorry
if you see it this way.

Anyway, please stop ad-hominem attacks on me!

I just described what I see as a problem that prevents
us from dropping version parsing.

Technical comments, below, but really, these should go to
dm-devel only to not waste time of others.

Perhaps, but there was nothing better. If I missed something,
we can definitely make the code better.

TBH, I do even think that it uses the same logic as libdevmapper library
(and perhaps it dates even before I started to maintain it).

I do not see fundamental problem here, though.

I take is as "The dm-integrity was introduced in kernel/target X",
then I do not expect it working in X-1...

I just meant that if userspace want to support older kernels,
we need to support both.

If it does not bring fixes for the problem I described, it is just
more code with no effect (for libcryptsetup).

But if you see other reasons, then of course it makes sense.

I am sure I mentioned this, but years ago... what I am talking about

1) Some ti->error messages are lost, e.g. in dm-crypt,
   I think example is IV generators constructors
   if (ret < 0) {
      ti->error = "Error creating IV";
   ...
   (And yes, I should fix this myself.)


2) Targets use macros like DMERR, these generate syslog message.
    Getting these messages into userspace is problematic.

    But perhaps this is more problem for libdevmapper we use.

I am talking about situation when user explicitly requests to use tasklets
on CLI and kernel does not support it. Then there must be an error message.

I am not sure if we should automatically fallback to non-tasklets,
but we do this already in other situations (enable-discards, keyring support, ...)

And nobody asked for this as we are already doing this in userspace.

It was really just example to demonstrate when we use target version.

Great, let's discuss this later.

Yes, I tried to say that syslog itself as source is problematic
(if you activate many devices in parallel; in multi-tenant environment
when you should not see logs from different users etc).

It works pretty reliably for years with some minor exceptions that
can be ignored.
