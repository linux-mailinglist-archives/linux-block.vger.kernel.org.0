But most operations initiated by the user that fail will be felt by the
upper layer that the user is interfacing with.

Only exception that springs to mind is dm-writecache's writeback that
occurs after writes have already been acknowledged back to the upper
layers -- in that case dm-writecache provides an error flag that is
exposed via writecache_status.

Anyway, just not seeing why you need a upper-layer use-case agnostic
flag to know an error occurred in DM.  That layers that interface with
the DM device will have been notified of all errors.

And why just for DM devices?  Why not all block devices (in which case
DM would get this feature "for free")?
