Hi John,

It seems like I should have done a better job of explaining that change.
On v2 I received the following feedback from Hannes: "What I don't
particularly like is the global blk_sched_srcu here; can't
we make it per tagset?". My reply was as follows: "I'm concerned about
the additional memory required for one srcu_struct per tag set." Hence
the switch from SRCU to RCU + rwsem. See also
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/d1627890-fb10-7ebe-d805-621f925f80e7@suse.de/.

Regarding the 1% performance drop measured by Jens: with debugging
disabled srcu_dereference() is translated into READ_ONCE() and
rcu_assign_pointer() is translated into smp_store_release(). On x86
smp_store_release() is translated into a compiler barrier +
WRITE_ONCE(). In other words, I do not expect that the performance
difference came from the switch to SRCU but rather from the two new
hctx->tags->rqs[] assignments.

I think that the switch to READ_ONCE() / WRITE_ONCE() is unavoidable.
Even if cmpxchg() would be used to clear hctx->tags->rqs[] pointers then
we would need to convert all other hctx->tags->rqs[] accesses into
READ_ONCE() / WRITE_ONCE() to make that cmpxchg() call safe.

Bart.
