I come to realize this is really an idea on the opposite. Let me try to
explain what I understand, please correct me if I am wrong. The idea you
proposed indeed is to make bcache act as something like FTL for the
backend zoned SMR drive, that is, for all random writes, bcache may
convert them into sequential write onto the backend zoned SMR drive. In
the meantime, if there are hot data, bcache continues to act as a
caching device to accelerate read request.

Yes, if I understand your proposal correctly, writeback mode might be
mandatory and backend-GC will be needed. The idea is interesting, it
looks like adding a log-structure storage layer between current bcache
B+tree indexing and zoned SMR hard drive.
