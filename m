I was curious whether or not Martin's comments about "mkfs already
considers the reported queue limits (for the filesystems most people use,
anyway)" applies to say XFS [0] and whether or not the above helps guide
mkfs that way, so I took a look now.

[0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/yq1ttytbox9.fsf@ca-mkp.ca.oracle.com/

There's a default struct mkfs_default_params which sets the blocksize
to 1 << XFS_DFL_BLOCKSIZE_LOG and so at least validate_blocksize() will
use that if no parameter was passed on the cli. We also set the default
sector size to XFS_MIN_SECTORSIZE.

There are two aspects to what we use for the final mkfs, first we use
validate_blocksize(), then validate_sectorsize(). The first will set
the default block size to  1 << XFS_DFL_BLOCKSIZE_LOG (4096 bytes) if
the user did not specify anything. Then validate_sectorsize() uses
get_topology() to get the physical / logical block sizes and both:

  * blkid_topology_get_minimum_io_size()
  * blkid_topology_get_optimal_io_size()

These come from utilil-linux:

https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux.git

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-block

So that's just

/sys/block/<disk>/queue/physical_block_size
/sys/block/<disk>/queue/logical_block_size

Then:

/sys/block/<disk>/queue/minimum_io_size

The documentation suggests " For disk drives this is often the physical block size."

/sys/block/<disk>/queue/optimal_io_size

The documentation suggests this is "This is rarely reported for disk drives."

From my review of xfs's mkfs is we essentially use the physical block
size as a default sector size if set, otherwise we use the device's logical block
size if set otherwise xfsprog's default and so 4096.

And so the above comment referring to DAX could be killed and replaced
with allowing userspace mkfs utils to use a more appropriate block size.
Or just kill the comment all together and we update the docs for
blk_queue_physical_block_size() instead.

Looking at this:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/62ef05515b085_1b3c29434@dwillia2-xfh.jf.intel.com.notmuch/

> Should we EOL DAX too?

I think the answer is no as a generic kernel thing, however, it probably
means we should really update the DAX documentation to reflect what our
real expecations are for its current and future uses. And that is to
highlight the non-PMEM use cases as *those* probably are EOL'd now.
