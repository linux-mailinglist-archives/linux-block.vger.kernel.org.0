My concern is this:

struct scsi_device *scsi_get_host_dev(struct Scsi_Host *shost)
{
	[ .. ]
	starget = scsi_alloc_target(&shost->shost_gendev, 0, shost->this_id);
	[ .. ]

and we have typically:

drivers/scsi/hisi_sas/hisi_sas_v3_hw.c: .this_id                = -1,

It's _very_ uncommon to have a negative number as the SCSI target 
device; in fact, it _is_ an unsigned int already.

But alright, I'll give it a go; let's see what I'll end up with.

Cheers,

Hannes
