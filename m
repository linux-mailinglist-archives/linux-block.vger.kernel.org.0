Well, surprise, surprise, both our patchsets are largely identical ...

So how to proceed? I guess if you were using 'cdev' instead of 
'regu_dm_dev' we should be having an overlap of about 90 percent.

The main difference between our implementation is that I didn't move the 
metadata to the cache/regulard device, seeing that dmzadm will only 
write metadata onto the zoned device.
I would rather keep it that way (ie storing metadata on the zoned 
device, too, if possible) as we would be keeping backwards compability 
with that.
And we could always move metadata to the cache/regular device in a later 
patch; for doing it properly we'll need to update the metadata anyway as 
we need to introduce UUIDs to stitch those devices together.
Remember, one my have more than one zoned device and regular device...

Should I try to merge both patchsets and send them out as an RFC?

Cheers,

Hannes
