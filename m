I was going to ask if being more explit would be better:

diff --git a/block/blk-mq.c b/block/blk-mq.c
index 4f57d27bfa73..96816ce57eb1 100644
--- a/block/blk-mq.c

 {
         /*

          */
-        if (rq->state == MQ_RQ_IN_FLIGHT && rq->q == hctx->queue) {
+        if ((rq->state == MQ_RQ_IN_FLIGHT || rq->state == MQ_RQ_COMPLETE) &&
+            rq->q == hctx->queue) {
                 bool *busy = priv;

                 *busy = true;

But is your patch more forgiving of any future blk-mq states that might
also consistitute outstanding work?  Seems likely.

Thanks,
Mike
