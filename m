The key difference between ZNS SSDs, and OCSSDs is that wear-leveling is 
done on the SSD, whereas it is on the host with OCSSD.

While that is interesting in itself, the bulk of the research that is 
based upon OCSSD, is to control which dies are accessed. As that is 
already compatible with NVMe Endurance Groups/NVM Sets, there is really 
no reason to keep OCSSD around to have that flexibility.

If we take it out of the kernel, it would still be maintained in the 
github repository and available for researchers. Given the few changes 
that have happened over the past year, it should be relatively easy to 
rebase for each kernel release for quite a while.

Best, Matias
