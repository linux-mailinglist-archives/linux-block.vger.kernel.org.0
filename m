IIUC this patch is essentially a band-aid to get back to the scalability that was possible before persistent grant support was added. Ultimately the right answer should be to get rid of persistent grants support and use grant copy, but such a change is clearly more invasive and would need far more testing.

Persistent grants are hogging ballooned pages, which is equivalent to
memory only in case of the backend's domain memory being equal or
rather near to its max memory size.

So configuring the backend domain with enough spare area for ballooned
pages should make this problem much less serious.

Another problem in this area is the amount of maptrack frames configured
for a driver domain, which will limit the number of concurrent foreign
mappings of that domain.

So instead of having a blkback specific solution I'd rather have a
common callback for backends to release foreign mappings in order to
enable a global resource management.
