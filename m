In other words, a fs claims it can do file-backed-mounts
without a new context only if:

  - Its own implementation can be safely applied to any
    other kernel filesystem (e.g., it shouldn't change
    current->journal_info or do context save/restore before
    handing over, for example); and its own implementation
    can safely mount itself with file-backed mounts.

So it's filesystem-specific internals to make sure it can
work like this (for example ext4 on erofs, ext4 still uses
loop to mount). The virtual block device layer knows
nothing about what the upper filesystem did before the
execution passes through, so it's unsafe to work like this.

Thanks,
