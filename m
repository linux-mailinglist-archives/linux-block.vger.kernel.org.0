So I've finally had a chance to take a real look at this...

Honestly, I think that this is out of scope for a document on coding
style.  That document is already far too long for most people to read, I
don't think we should load it down with more stuff that isn't directly
style related.

That said, the information can be useful.  I wanted to say that it should
go with the documentation of the pr_* macros but ... well ... um ... we
don't seem to have a whole lot of that.  Figures.

I suspect this is more than you wanted to sign up for, but...IMO, the right
thing to do is to fill printk.h with a nice set of kerneldoc comments
describing how this stuff should be used, then to pull that information
into the core-api manual, somewhere near our extensive discussion of printk
formats.  It's amazing that we lack docs for something so basic.

Thanks,

jon
