Subject: [PATCH 22/29] bcache: shrink btree node cache after bch_btree_check()

When cache set starts, bch_btree_check() will check all bkeys on cache
device by calculating the checksum. This operation will consume a huge
number of system memory if there are a lot of data cached. Since bcache
uses its own mca cache to maintain all its read-in btree nodes, and only
releases the cache space when system memory manage code starts to shrink
caches. There is will be a delay between bch_btree_check() returns and
the bcache shrink code gets called, so following memory allocatiion
might fail after bch_btree_check() finished. The most frequent one is
failure of creating allocator kernel thread.

This patch tries to proactively call bcache mca shrinker routine to
release around 25% cache memory, to help following memory allocation
to success. 'Around 25% cache memory' means when mca shrnker tries to
release cache memory, it might have to skip some busy memory objects,
so the result might be a few less than the expected amount.
