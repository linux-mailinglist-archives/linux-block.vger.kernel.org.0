Which is thinking, too.
While it might be that some I/O can arrive during shutdown, it is 
_quite_ questionable whether one may want to trace it.
And if so whether blktrace/debugfs is the correct way to do it, as it's 
certainly not performance critical, and there are other things at play 
during shutdown having a much larger impact on the overall timing (rcu 
grace periods, lock contention, you name it).

So I'd say we should go for least complexity here, and allow tracing 
only if the device is in a sane state.

Cheers,

Hannes
