Hi Damien,

Thanks for the feedback. I agree that it would be great to have zone append
support in F2FS. However, I do not agree that switching from regular writes
to zone append in F2FS would remove the need for sorting SCSI commands by LBA
in the SCSI error handler. Even if F2FS would submit zoned writes then the
following mechanisms could still cause reordering of the zoned writes after
these have been translated into regular writes:
* The SCSI protocol allows SCSI devices, including UFS devices, to respond
with a unit attention or the SCSI BUSY status at any time. If multiple write
commands are pending and some of the pending SCSI writes are not executed
because of a unit attention or because of another reason, this causes
command reordering.
* Although the link between the UFS controller and the UFS device is pretty
reliable, there is a non-zero chance that a SCSI command is lost. If this
happens the SCSI timeout and error handlers are activated. This can cause
reordering of write commands.

In other words, whether F2FS submits regular writes (REQ_OP_WRITE) or zone
appends (REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND), I think we need the entire patch series.

Thanks,

Bart.
