We've discussed it [1]. The commit was merged in 4.14 which shows that the
breakage is not that severe as nobody noticed until now. Actually I did
some more digging in history now and until commit 743210386c "cgroup: use
cgrp->kn->id as the cgroup ID" from last November the breakage was only
visible if you had CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP enabled and had bio with bi_blkcg set
or trace note messages for non-trivial cgroups (effectively only BFQ
informational messages). After that commit trace note messages are broken
whenever you have CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP. So the reason why nobody noticed is
probably because until 5.5 the breakage was actually difficult to hit.

So I'm undecided whether at this point it's better to revert the original
commit (as likely there is other tooling that depends on this info), just
fix the fact that since commit 743210386c all trace note messages will have
non-empty cgroup info, or just fixup blkparse and move on...
