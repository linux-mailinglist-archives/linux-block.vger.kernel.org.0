Hmm, strikes me as strange that this is occurring given the direct
insertion into blk-mq queue (bypassing scheduler) is meant to avoid 2
layers of IO merging when dm-mulipath is stacked on blk-mq path(s).  The
dm-mpath IO scheduler does all merging and underlying paths' blk-mq
request_queues are meant to just dispatch the top-level's requests.

So this change concerns me.  Feels like this design has broken down.

Could be that some other entry point was added for the
__blk_mq_try_issue_directly() code?  And it needs to be untangled away
from the dm-multipath use-case?

Apologies for not responding to this patch until now.

Mike
