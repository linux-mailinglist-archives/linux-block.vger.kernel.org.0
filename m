It's hard to make sure if a failure is a regression, if someone only run
the test once. The testers need some experience, at least need some
history test data.

If a tester find a case has 10% chance fail on his system, to make sure
it's a regression or not, if he doesn't have history test data, at least
he need to do the same test more times on old kernel version with his
system. If it never fail on old kernel version, but can fail on new kernel.
Then we suspect it's a regression.

Even if the tester isn't an expert of the fs he's testing, he can report
this issue to that fs experts, to get more checking. For downstream kernel,
he has to report to the maintainers of downstream, or check by himself.
If a case pass on upstream, but fail on downstream, it might mean there's
a patchset on upstream can be backported.

So, anyway, the testers need their own "experience" (include testing history
data, known issue, etc) to judge if a failure is a suspected regression, or
a known issue of downstream which hasn't been fixed (by backport).

That's my personal perspective :)

Thanks,
Zorro
