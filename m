Yes I will update comment, I don't know how I missed updating it :(

yes I will add proper comment.

Yes I would do add proper commit log as suggested

You are absolutely correct and that was my original plan to do away with
->store_nolock and ->show_nolock methods in the end however problem arised
due to "read_ahead_kb" attribute. As you know, "read_ahead_kb" requires
update outside of atomic limit APIs (for the reason mentioned in last 
patch comment as well as in the cover letter).  So we can't move 
"read_ahead_kb" into ->store_limit. For updating "read_ahead_kb", 
we follow the below sequence:

lock ->limits_lock
  lock ->freeze_lock
    update bdi->ra_pages
  unlock ->freeze_lock
unlock ->limits_lock

As you could see above, we have to take ->limits_lock before ->freeze_lock 
while updating ra_pages (doing the opposite would surely trigger lockdep 
splat). However for attributes which are grouped under ->store_nolock the
update sequence is:

lock ->freeze_lock 
  invoke attribute specific store method
unlock ->freeze_lock.

So now if you suggest keeping only ->store and do away with ->store_nolock
method then we have to move feeze-lock inside each attributes' corresponding 
store method as we can't keep freeze-lock under ->store in queue_attr_store().

yes agreed, I would remove ->load_module and we can now load module 
from elevator ->store method directly before we freeze the queue.

Yes this is possible and I just kept it for pairing show_nolock with
store_nolock. But I would remove it.

Yes this can be done. I will add it when I spin next patchset.
