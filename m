Another thing to fix from there, just make it:

if (cache->size)
	return cached item
return NULL;

No need for an if/else with the return.

If the API doesn't support freeing from interrupts, then I'd make that
the rule. Caller should know better if that can happen, and then just
use kmem_cache_free() if in a problematic context. That avoids polluting
the fast path with that check. I'd still make it a WARN_ON_ONCE() as
described and it can get removed later, hopefully.

But note it's not just the freeing side that would be problematic. If
you do support from-irq freeing, then the alloc side would need
local_irq_save/restore() instead of just basic preempt protection. That
would make it more expensive all around.

Not sure that's actually true, apart from being bitrot.

Please also run some actual comparitative benchmarks on this, with a
real workload. You also need an internal user of this, a stand-alone
feature isn't really useful. It needs someone using it, and the
benchmarks would be based on that (or those) use cases.

Another consideration - is it going to be OK to ignore slab pruning for
this? Probably. But it needs to be thought about.

In terms of API, not sure why these are separate functions. Creating the
cache with SLAB_FOO should be enough, and then kmem_cache_alloc() tries
the cache first. If nothing there, fallback to the regular path.
Something like this would only be used for cases that have a high
alloc+free rate, would seem like a shame to need two function calls for
the case where you just want a piece of memory and the cache is empty.
