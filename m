Hi

Do you mead the suggestion that you mentioned in another email:
"a varied_rq_size flag, similar to the varied_weights flag" ?
I'm afraid that's just a circumvention plan, not a solution to the
special case.

By the way, I'm glad if there is anything I can help, however it'll
wait for a few days cause the Spring Festival is coming.

Thanks,
Yu Kuai
