Subject: [PATCH v2] SCSI and block: Simplify resume handling

Commit 05d18ae1cc8a ("scsi: pm: Balance pm_only counter of request
queue during system resume") fixed a problem in the block layer's
runtime-PM code: blk_set_runtime_active() failed to call
blk_clear_pm_only().  However, the commit's implementation was
awkward; it forced the SCSI system-resume handler to choose whether to
call blk_post_runtime_resume() or blk_set_runtime_active(), depending
on whether or not the SCSI device had previously been runtime
suspended.

This patch simplifies the situation considerably by adding the missing
function call directly into blk_set_runtime_active() (under the
condition that the queue is not already in the RPM_ACTIVE state).
This allows the SCSI routine to revert back to its original form.
Furthermore, making this change reveals that blk_post_runtime_resume()
(in its success pathway) does exactly the same thing as
blk_set_runtime_active().  The duplicate code is easily removed by
making one routine call the other.

No functional changes are intended.

v2:	Don't call blk_clear_pm_only() if the queue's RPM status was
	already set to RPM_ACTIVE.  This happens during a system resume
	if the device was not in runtime suspend beforehand.

Martin:

Since you merged the oritinal 05d18ae1cc8a commit, I'm submitting this to
you as an update.  If you would prefer to have it go by way of the
block-layer tree, let me know and I'll resend it.
