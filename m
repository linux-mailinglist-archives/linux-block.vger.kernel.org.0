From the pure sysfs perspective, yes.  The weird thing with block
layer sysfs is that unregistration/registration can happen at weird
times, though.

So sysfs_dir_lock absolutely should go.  OTOH relying more on sysfs_lock
is a bad idea, as that is also serialied with the attributes, which
again on a pure sysfs basis isn't needed.  Given that you don't add
new critical sections for it this should be fine, though.

Using an atomic_t for a single variable is usually not a good idea.
Let's take a step back and look at what mq_sysfs_init_done is trying
to do.

It is set by blk_mq_sysfs_register, which is called by
blk_register_queue. before marking the queue registered and setting the
disk live.  It is cleared in blk_mq_sysfs_unregister called from
blk_unregister_queue just after clearing the queue registered bit.

So maybe we could do something with the queue registered bit, although
eventually I'd like to kill that as well, but either way we need
to explain how the flag prevents the nr_hw_queues update racing with
disk addition/removal.  AFAICS we're not completely getting this
right even right now.  We'd probably need to hold tag_list_lock
over registering and unregistering the hctx sysfs files.
