Which so far is expected.  Even with O_DIRECT you need O_(D)SYNC or
fsync/fdatasync to persist data.

xfs_io -c fsync /dev/foo

I wouldn't expect it.  It's a really weird legacy thing that calls
back up into the file system, but only if it sets s_bdev to this
device.  I don't think we should add new users of it that overload the
semantics.
