I'm not surprised :-) I infer from your reply that you acknowledge this
is something that should be done one way or the other, and I'm glad
about that.

Thanks, much appreciated.

This I can explain. I need to check t->type->message because not all
targets define it. If I didn't, yet used message(), the kernel might
crash. I would have avoided the hard-coded "fail_path", too, if I had
found a way to figure out which messages a given target supports, or
whether the target in question is the multipath target in the first
place. But I couldn't figure it out. If it's possible, please tell me
how. 

Wrt "fail_path", the assumption is that other rq-based targets would
either not support "fail_path" and thus return an error, or implement
it with the same semantics as multipath. In both cases, my patch would
do the "right thing" (falling back to standard behavior in the error
case).

Thanks,
Martin
