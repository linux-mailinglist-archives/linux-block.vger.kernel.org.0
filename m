Adriano was getting 1.5ms sync-write ioping's to an NVMe through bcache 
(instead of the expected ~70us), so perhaps the NVMe flushes were killing 
performance if every write was also forcing an erase cycle.

The suggestion was to disable flushes in bcache as a troubleshooting step 
to see if that solved the problem, but with the warning that it could be 
unsafe.

Questions:

1. If a user knows their disks have a non-volatile cache then is it safe 
   to drop flushes?

2. If not, then under what circumstances is it unsafe with a non-volatile 
   cache?
  
3. Since the block layer wont send flushes when the hardware reports that 
   the cache is non-volatile, then how do you query the device to make 
   sure it is reporting correctly?  For NVMe you can get VWC as:
	nvme id-ctrl -H /dev/nvme0 |grep -A1 vwc
   
   ...but how do you query a block device (like a RAID LUN) to make sure 
   it is reporting a non-volatile cache correctly?
