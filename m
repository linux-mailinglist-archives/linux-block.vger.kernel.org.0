I'm interested in this general topic too. One of our use cases is
that we need to process network data in some degree since many
protocols are application layer protocols so it seems more reasonable
to process such protocols in userspace. And another difference is that
we may have thousands of devices in a machine since we'd better to run
containers as many as possible so the block device solution seems
suboptimal to us. Yet I'm still interested in this topic to get more
ideas.

Btw, As for general userspace block device solutions, IMHO, there could
be some deadlock issues out of direct reclaim, writeback, and userspace
implementation due to writeback user requests can be tripped back to
the kernel side (even the dependency crosses threads). I think they are
somewhat hard to fix with user block device solutions. For example,
https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAM1OiDPxh0B1sXkyGCSTEpdgDd196-ftzLE-ocnM8Jd2F9w7AA@mail.gmail.com
