It sounds like we just needed to settle on the formats. And a few more
eyeballs / reviewed-by's. No? And it sounds like Jens is about to punt
a new series :)

I think it would be good to split this into two parts:

 * io-uring cmd extensions
 * what can be extended for nvme

io-uring cmd is not even upstream yet, so I don't think folks widely really
realize the potential yet. So I think it's a bit too early to tell here,
and so we should go out and preach at things like Plumbers and other
conferences with a few nice demos of what can be done. nvme being one
use case, but I think it would help to get other users active and not
just vaporware.

The problem I'm seeing with this effort too is it relies too heavily
on the nvme passthrough being the only use case so far, and that's
a bit too involved. So I'd like to encourage other simple users
to consider helping here.

Granted this is like looking for a nail when you're hammer. And so
the only way to not have it be that way is to aim smaller, a simple
real demo of something useful. I don't know.. I'd think something like
trinity might have a field day with this.

I think we are being to hard on ourselves. Start small, and, get some
basic stuff up. And allow for flexibility for improvement. I think
at this point we have more than proof of concept no but something
tangible?

If the goal was to help open the door for unsupported commands then
in so far as upstream is concerned shouldn't we only care about the
generic plumbing? ie, specific commands / which might not yet be
baked for general consumption (like zone append) are left to up to
implementors to figure out where they test. Let's use zone append
as an example. Without a raw block interface to it, we can use this
framework, ideally.. but yeah how do we test? Are vendors all going
to agree to use microbenches with io-uring cmd?

I failed to capture where 2.0 and 3.0 are defined. Can you elaborate?
