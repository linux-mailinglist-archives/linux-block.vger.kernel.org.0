Thanks for your test!

Especially this patch changes flush & passthrough IO handling during
CPU hotplug, if possible, please include the two kinds of background IO
when running cpu hotplug test.

BTW, I verified the patches by running 'dbench -s 64' & concurrent NVMe
user IO during cpu hotplug, looks it works fine.

Also there is one known performance drop issue reported by John, which has
been addressed in the following link:

https://github.com/ming1/linux/commit/1cfbe1b2f7fd7085bc86e09c6443a20e89142975


Thanks,
Ming
