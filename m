I do remember that fix, but curious if there's still something wrong
here...

Gotcha

Yes, this is totally wrong. If we assume a single ring, and a single
thread/task driving this ring, then any IO being put into the ring is
issued IN ORDER on the kernel side by that very same task once said task
does io_uring_enter() to submit whatever it put in the ring.

Like I mentioned earlier, there's _zero_ difference in the ordering in
which these are issued between libaio and io_uring, for a single ring
(or context) and a single task doing the submit and/or wait for events
call.

Fio doesn't have multiple threads operating on a ring, there's always a
single ring per IO thread. Yes if you use multiple jobs and expect those
to be ordered, that would obviously be broken across the board,
regardless of IO engine used. So I realize this isn't the case. But
there still seems to be some misunderstandings here on how io_uring
works, and maybe even then an issue that's not being fully understood or
blamed on something else.
