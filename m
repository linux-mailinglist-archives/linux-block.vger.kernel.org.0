Hi Kuai,
I haven't checked all details, but, for sure, two bfq_queues belonging
to different parent entities (i.e., to different groups) do not have
to be merged.  So, if two bfq_queues happen to be (still) merged while
belonging to different groups, then the scheduler is in an
inconsistent state.  And rules may follow.

Let's see comments from the other people working on this issue.

Thanks for spotting this,
Paolo
