I'd prefer different naming for the char vs the block devices.  Yes,
this will require a little work in the userspace tools to support the
character device, but I think it is much cleaner.

Devices in subdirectories of /dev/ are very rare and keep causing problem
with userspace tooling for the few drivers that use them, so I don't
think they are a good idea.
