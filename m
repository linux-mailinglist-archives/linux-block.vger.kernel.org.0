1.percpu_ref need introduce fail status for hctc_lock to avoid possible
long waits for synchronization, need do some extra work for failed hctx_lock .
Just like this which in the patch:
@@ -2057,11 +2051,14 @@ static void blk_mq_try_issue_directly(struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *hctx,
  		struct request *rq, blk_qc_t *cookie)
  {
  	blk_status_t ret;
-	int srcu_idx;

  	might_sleep_if(hctx->flags & BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING);

-	hctx_lock(hctx, &srcu_idx);
+	/* Insert request to queue in case of being quiesced */
+	if (!hctx_lock(hctx)) {
+		blk_mq_sched_insert_request(rq, false, false, false);
+		return;
+	}

Now is simple, the code can work well. If the logic gets complicated,
it's probably hard to handle.
For example: for some unkown reason, if we may introduce some mechanism(such
as check other flag or state) for dispatch or issue requests, we may need do
more extra works in the branch of failed hctx_lock. perhaps more seriously,
it may hard to be handled in this branch. If we need do like this
in __blk_mq_try_issue_directly.
	if (blk_mq_hctx_stopped(hctx) || blk_queue_quiesced(q)) {
		run_queue = false;
		bypass_insert = false;
		goto insert;
+	} else if (blk_queue_xxx(q)) {
+		/*do some other things*/
+       }
Of course, there's a good chance it won't happen.
