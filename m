Yes, because you focused on the block layer when the actual issue is in DM.

Any zoned DM target that uses zone append emulation will use zone write
plugging. If in addition to this, the target driver uses
dm_accept_partial_bio() to internally split BIOs, it can happen that a BIO that
was plugged and issued from a zone write plug bio work is split using
dm_accept_partial_bio(). In this case, the reminder of the BIO is issued again
and thus there is a call to blk_queue_enter() which will block if a queue
freeze is ongoing. This blocking is in the zone write plug bio work, which
result in no forward progress: BIOs plugged are never unplugged and processed.
Here is your deadlock.

So the solution is to force a split to the DM device limits of any write BIO in
dm core, before the BIO is passed to the DM target map() function, *AND*
prevent the target driver from further splitting a write BIO using
dm_accept_partial_bio().

Only dm-crypt is affected by this. dm-flakey supports zoned targets and uses
dm_accept_partial_bio() but it does not require zone append emulation so does
not use zone write plugging.

Sending clean patches in a short while. I tested with your zbd/013 reproducer
and all is good.
