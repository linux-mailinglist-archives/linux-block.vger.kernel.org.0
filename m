Could you provide more info about your systems' topology and irq setup please?

I don't think it does. If rq_affinity is set to 1, then it is set to match the
performance of the requester to do the completion.

If you set the sysfs rq_affinity to 0, you should be able to distribute things
without block layer trying to match anything?

rq_affinity = 1 is asking to match the performance of the
requester/orginitaor. On HMP system, this means looking at grouping based on
capacity, not just LLC.

What is the issue of contention? Could you please explain it in more details?

Assuming you want to use rq_affinity = 1 to match based on LLC but not
capacity. I'm curious why you want to match on LLC only but not capacity.

Is this on 6.1 kernel and beyond? Arm systems should have a shared LLC based on
DSU that is enforced in topology in 6.1. So can't see why you want to match
based on LLC but not capacity. Could you provide more info please?

If you don't want block layer to do any affinity, isn't it better to set
rq_affinity = 0?

Why this consideration matters when matching the perf based on capacity but it
doesn't matter when matching it based on LLC?

They are not the samae. rq_affinity = 1 means match. So if both are on the same
LLC or capacity, no need to force anything. rq_affinity = 2 means always match.
It's not the same thing, is it?
