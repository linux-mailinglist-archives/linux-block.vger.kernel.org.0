Follows the idea:

- adding new type of buffer(splice buffer) to io_uring, this
buffer will be populated into bvec table(reusing io_mapped_ubuf) by
passing (splice_fd, offset, len) from SQE.

- The buffer is filled from ublk ->read_splice() with help of
splice_direct_to_actor() over direct pipe, probably we can add one
private splice flag to just allow ublk ->read_splice() to be available
in kernel(io_uring) & direct pipe

- It requires the pipe buffer ownership not transferred, so nop_pipe_buf_ops
is needed for such usage, and this way is pretty fine for ublk & fuse.

- The buffer can be allocated & populated from ->prep() of io_uring rw/net,
then handled just like READ[WRITE]_FIXED.

So it is like normal async read/write, then two pin pages are avoided,
and one time of io data copy is saved.

This way is also flexible to allow read/write over any part of the buffer.

Thanks,
Ming
