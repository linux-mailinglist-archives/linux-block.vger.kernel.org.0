Subject: [PATCH v2 1/2] md raid0/linear: Introduce new array state 'broken'
Date:   Fri, 16 Aug 2019 10:40:58 -0300
Message-Id: <20190816134059.29751-1-gpiccoli@canonical.com>

Currently if md raid0/linear array gets one or more members removed while
being mounted, kernel keeps showing state 'clean' in the 'array_state'
sysfs attribute. Despite udev signaling the member device is gone, 'mdadm'
cannot issue the STOP_ARRAY ioctl successfully, given the array is mounted.

Nothing else hints that something is wrong (except that the removed devices
don't show properly in the output of 'mdadm detail' command). There is no
other property to be checked, and if user is not performing reads/writes
to the array, even kernel log is quiet and doesn't give a clue about the
missing member.

This patch changes this behavior; when 'array_state' is read we introduce
a non-expensive check (only for raid0/md-linear) that relies in the
comparison of the total number of disks when array was assembled with
gendisk flags of those devices to validate if all members are available
and functional. A new array state 'broken' was added: it mimics the state
'clean' in every aspect, being useful only to distinguish if such array
has some member missing. Also, we show a rate-limited warning in kernel
log in such case.

This patch has no proper functional change other than adding the
'clean'-like state; it was tested with ext4 and xfs filesystems. It
requires a 'mdadm' counterpart to handle the 'broken' state.

Cover-letter from v1:
lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20190729203135.12934-1-gpiccoli@canonical.com

v1 -> v2:
* Added handling for md/linear 'broken' state;
* Check for is_missing_dev() instead of personality (thanks Neil for
the suggestion);
* Changed is_missing_dev() handlers to static;
* Print rate-limited warning in case of more members go away, not only
the first.

Song, after thinking and experimenting a bit more, I don't think it
makes sense to allow setting the 'broken' state, unless we refactor
and "re-purpose" this state. What 'broken' really means is a 'clean'
state but with 1+ members missing - setting it is the same as set
'clean', so it'd be counter-intuitive to set 'broken' but having in
fact set 'clean' merely with the name 'broken'.

The purpose of 'broken' is really to only indicate a missing member,
as noticed by kernel in array_state reads.
If you really think we should use 'broken' for other purposes and hence
users should be allowed to set it, let's discuss and rewrite it.
Personally I think the less we change, the better. We just need
some way to warn users about the missing members of their arrays.
Thanks,

Guilherme
