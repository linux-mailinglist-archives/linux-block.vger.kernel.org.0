Thanks for that suggestion. Indeed, I'd like nothing more than to get rid of
that Perc 5/i card, even if it can't be as bad as what I'm seeing.
That said, from some reading, an H700 isn't just a swap in replacement, it
doesn't use the same cables from what I can tell.

Perc 6/i does use the same cables, but it's barely a better card than 5/i
