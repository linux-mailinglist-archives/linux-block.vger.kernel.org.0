It's much less about using whatever amount of memory for inflight IO,
and much more about not bloating fast path structures (of which the bio
is certainly one). All of this gunk has to be initialized for each IO,
and that's the real issue.

Just look at the recent work for iov_iter and why ITER_UBUF makes sense
to do.

This is not a commentary on this patchset, just a general observation.
Sizes of hot data structures DO matter, and quite a bit so.
