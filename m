Unfortunately, the fallback doesn't completely handle that situation
right now. The DM device could be suspended while an upper layer like
fscrypt is doing something like "checking if encryption algorithm 'A'
is supported by the DM device". It's possible that fscrypt thinks
the DM device supports 'A' even though the DM device is suspended, and
the table is about to be reloaded to introduce a new device that doesn't
support 'A'. Before the DM device is resumed with the new table, fscrypt
might send a bio that uses encryption algorithm 'A' without initializing
the blk-crypto-fallback ciphers for 'A', because it believes that the DM
device supports 'A'. When the bio gets processed by the DM (or when
blk-crypto does its checks to decide whether to use the fallback on that
bio), the bio will fail because the fallback ciphers aren't initialized.

Off the top of my head, one thing we could do is to always allocate the
fallback ciphers when the device mapper is the target device for the bio
(by maybe adding a "encryption_capabilities_may_change_at_runtime" flag
to struct blk_keyslot_manager that the DM will set to true, and that
the block layer will check for and decide to appropriately allocate
the fallback ciphers), although this does waste memory on systems
where we know the DM device tables will never change....

This patch also doesn't handle the case when the encryption capabilities
of the new table are a superset of the old capabilities.  Currently, a
DM device's capabilities can only shrink after the device is initially
created. They can never "expand" to make use of capabilities that might
be added due to introduction of new devices via table reloads.  I might
be forgetting something I thought of before, but looking at it again
now, I don't immediately see anything wrong with expanding the
advertised capabilities on table reload....I'll look carefully into that
again.

So the motivation for this code was that Android currently uses a device
mapper target on top of a phone's disk for user data. On many phones,
that disk has inline encryption support, and it'd be great to be able to
make use of that. The DM device configuration isn't changed at runtime.
