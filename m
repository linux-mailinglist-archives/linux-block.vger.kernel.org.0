We increase paths_num and insert element into the list while holding
paths_mutex. The readers only do rcu_readlock and rcu_readunlock when
iterating over the list, they do not take the paths_mutex, so there is
a window where they can see the increased paths_num, but the element
isn't yet in the list...
