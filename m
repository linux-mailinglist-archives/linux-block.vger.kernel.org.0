We wait to allocate the buffer until we get UBLK_IO_RES_NEED_GET_DATA completion and submit again using UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA.  After we get the UBLK_IO_RES_OK completion from ublk, we submit the block request to the SPDK bdev layer.  After it completes, we submit using UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ and can free the I/O buffer because the data has been committed.

But after the read operation is completed and SPDK submits the UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ, how do I know when ublk has finished copying data out of the buffer so that I can reuse that buffer?

This idea is good, IMO.
