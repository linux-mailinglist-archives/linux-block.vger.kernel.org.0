This kind of hang or lockup is usually related with cpu utilization, and
this patch may reduce cpu utilization in submission context.

'Before 620K' could be caused by busy queue when batching submission isn't
applied, so merge chance is increased. This patch applies batching
submission, so queue becomes not busy enough.

BTW, what is the queue depth of sdev and can_queue of shost for your hisilision SAS?

In yanhui's virt workload(qemu, libaio, dio, high queue depth, single
job), the patch can improve throughput much(>50%) when running
sequential write(dio, libaio, 16 jobs) to XFS. And it is observed that
IO merge is recovered to level of disabling host tags.

Thanks,
Ming
