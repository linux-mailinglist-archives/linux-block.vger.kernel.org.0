But this kind of serialization can still be added on top.

And with the trylock in the reclaim path I believe you can even avoid
the irq variants of the spinlock. But I might be wrong, so you should
try that with lockdep enabled. If it is working there is no harm done
when making the critical section larger, as memory allocations will
work as before.
