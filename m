Ah, strange. I never saw an issue with that test, though I didn't run
that one repeatedly with the latest branch. So maybe it was an
intermittent like I saw with 11spare-migration and I just missed it.

Yes, I can confirm those patches fix the bug I was seeing too.


I did a fairly quick review of the patches:

 - In the patch that introduces md_free_disk() it looks like md_free()
can still be called from the error path of md_alloc() before
mddev->gendisk is set... which seems to make things rather complicated
seeing we then can't use free_disk to finish the cleanup if the disk
hasn't been created yet. I probably need to take closer look at this
but, it might make more sense for the cleanup to remain in md_free() but
call kobject_put() in md_free_disk() and del_gendisk() in
mdev_delayed_delete(). Then md_alloc() can still use kobject_put() in
the error path and it makes a little more sense seeing we'd still be
freeing the kobject stuff in it's own release method instead of the
disks free method.

 - In the patch with md_rdevs_overlap, it looks like we remove the
rcu_read_lock(), which definitely seems out of place and probably isn't
correct. But the comment that was recreated still references the rcu so
probably should be changed.

 - The last patch has a typo in the title (disk is *a* freed).

Thanks!

Logan
