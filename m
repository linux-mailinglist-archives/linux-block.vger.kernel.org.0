It seems unlikely to me that the above analysis is correct. If this problem would occur with recent kernel versions, I think that it would already have been reported by other Linux users.

Thanks,

Hi Bart,

First of all, this problem is not easy to be tested. We have tested it hundreds of times, and the recurrence is low probability. Basically, it needs to run continuously for 15-20 days under the high pressure test.
After analyzing the reason, we modified it according to the method of V1, and continued to test for more than 30 days, and this problem did not appear. Finally I decided to submit this patch to upstream.
According to our code analysis, this problem scenario is one that may occur under polar probability, please re-examine my analysis process.

Thanks,

Gu Mi
