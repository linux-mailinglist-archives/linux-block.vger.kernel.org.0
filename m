I do not believe any of us have said that it is unreasonable to support. 
We've only asked that you make the patches for it.

All of us have communicated why Zone Append is a great addition to the 
Linux kernel. Also, as Christoph points out, this has not been a secret 
for the past couple of months, and as Martin pointed out, have been a 
wanted feature for the past decade in the Linux community.

I do want to politely point out, that you've got a very clear signal 
from the key storage maintainers. Each of them is part of the planet's 
best of the best and most well-respected software developers, that 
literally have built the storage stack that most of the world depends 
on. The storage stack that recently sent manned rockets into space. They 
each unanimously said that the Zone Append command is the right approach 
for the Linux kernel to reduce the overhead of I/O tracking for zoned 
block devices. It may be worth bringing this information to your 
engineering organization, and also potentially consider Zone Append 
support for devices that you intend to used with the Linux kernel 
storage stack.

Another approach, is to use SPDK, and bypass the Linux kernel. This 
might even be an advantage, your customers does not have to wait on the 
Linux distribution being released with a long term release, before they 
can even get started and deploy in volume. I.e., they will actually get 
faster to market, and your company will be able to sell more drives.
