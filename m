If you have size = capacity then you can do a cross-zone read. This is
only a problem when we have gaps.

One thing we have considered is that as we remove the PO2 constraint
from the block layer is that devices exposing PO2 zone sizes are able to
do the emulation the other way around to support things like this.

A device mapper is also a fine place to put this, but it seems like a
very simple task. Is it worth all the boilerplate code for the device
mapper only for this?
