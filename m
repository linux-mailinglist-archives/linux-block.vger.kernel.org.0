Subject: [PATCH v13 01/12] bcache: add initial data structures for nvm pages

This patch initializes the prototype data structures for nvm pages
allocator,

- struct bch_nvmpg_sb
  This is the super block allocated on each nvdimm namespace for the nvm
pages allocator. A nvdimm pages allocator set may have multiple name-
spaces, bch_nvmpg_sb->set_uuid is used to mark which nvdimm set this
namespace belongs to.

- struct bch_nvmpg_header
  This is a table for all heads of all allocation record lists. An allo-
cation record list traces all page(s) allocated from nvdimm namespace(s)
to a specific requester (identified by uuid). After system reboot, a
requester can retrieve all previously allocated nvdimm pages from its
record list by a pre-defined uuid.

- struct bch_nvmpg_head
  This is a head of an allocation record list. Each nvdimm pages
requester (typically it's a driver) has and only has one allocation
record list, and an allocated nvdimm page only belongs to a specific
allocation record list. Member uuid[] will be set as the requester's
uuid, e.g. for bcache it is the cache set uuid. Member label is not
mandatory, it is a human-readable string for debug purpose. The nvm
offset format pointers recs_offset[] point to the location of actual
allocator record lists on each namespace of the nvdimm pages allocator
set. Each per namespace record list is represented by the following
struct bch_nvmpg_recs.

- struct bch_nvmpg_recs
  This structure represents a requester's allocation record list. Member
uuid is same value as the uuid of its corresponding struct
bch_nvmpg_head. Member recs[] is a table of struct bch_pgalloc_rec
objects to trace all allocated nvmdimm pages. If the table recs[] is
full, the nvmpg format offset is a pointer points to the next struct
bch_nvmpg_recs object, nvm pages allocator will look for available free
allocation record there. All the linked struct bch_nvmpg_recs objects
compose a requester's allocation record list which is headed by the
above struct bch_nvmpg_head.

- struct bch_nvmpg_rec
  This structure records a range of allocated nvdimm pages. Member pgoff
is offset in unit of page size of this allocation range. Member order
indicates size of the allocation range by (1 << order) in unit of page
size. Because the nvdimm pages allocator set may have multiple nvdimm
namespaces, member ns_id is used to identify which namespace the pgoff
belongs to.
  - Bits  0 - 51: pgoff - is pages offset of the allocated pages.
  - Bits 52 - 57: order - allocated size in page_size * order-of-2
  - Bits 58 - 60: ns_id - identify which namespace the pages stays on
  - Bits 61 - 63: reserved.
Since each of the allocated nvm pages are power of 2, using 6 bits to
represent allocated size can have (1<<(1<<64) - 1) * PAGE_SIZE maximum
value. It can be a 76 bits width range size in byte for 4KB page size,
which is large enough currently.

All the structure members having _offset suffix are in a special format.
E.g. bch_nvmpg_sb.{sb_offset, pages_offset, set_header_offset},
bch_nvmpg_head.recs_offset, bch_nvmpg_recs.{head_offset, next_offset},
the offset value is 64bit, the most significant 3 bits are used to
identify which namespace this offset belongs to, and the rested 61 bits
are actual offset inside the namespace. Following patches will have
helper routines to do the conversion between memory pointer and offset.

+ * - The nvmpg offset format pointer
+ *   All member names ending with _offset in this header are nvmpg offset
+ * format pointer. The offset format is,
+ *       [highest 3 bits: ns_id]
+ *       [rested 61 bits: offset in No. ns_id namespace]
+ *
+ * The above offset is byte unit, the procedure to reference a nvmpg offset
+ * format pointer is,
+ * 1) Identify the namespace related in-memory structure by ns_id from the
+ *    highest 3 bits of offset value.
+ * 2) Get the DAX mapping base address from the in-memory structure.
+ * 3) Calculate the actual memory address on nvdimm by plusing the DAX base
+ *    address with offset value in rested low 61 bits.
+ * All related in-memory structure and conversion routines don't belong to
+ * user space api, they are defined by nvm-pages allocator code in
+ * drivers/md/bcache/nvm-pages.{c,h}
