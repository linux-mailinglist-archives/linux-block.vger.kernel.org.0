The problem that I anticipate in our space is that a generous timeout
will make impatient people reboot their chromebooks, losing us
information
about hangs.  But, this can be worked around by having multiple
different timeouts.  For instance, a thread that is expecting to do
something slow, can set a flag
to indicate that it wishes to be held against the more generous
criteria.  This is something I am tempted to do on older kernels where
we might not feel
comfortable backporting io_uring.

This is worth evaluating.
