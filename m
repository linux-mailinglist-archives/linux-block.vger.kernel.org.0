Both good questions. Here are some more.

3) How many users is sufficient to justify the cost of keeping ataflop 
around?

4) How long is the user count allowed to remain below that threshold, 
before the code is removed?

No, those are your words, not mine.

I agree that a bug report count can be a proxy for a user count, but there 
is always a confidence level attached to such statistical reasoning, which 
can and should be quantified.

It is when you over-simplify. The mere fact that Michael is working on 
this driver publicly will probably increase its user base.

I think you and I both know that code with non-zero user count regularly 
gets removed. I think the main criterion for keeping code around has 
always been the expense.

So I help with API modernization for the drivers I'm responsible for, to 
make them cheaper to keep around. Other people concerned about the cost of 
keeping code in the tree should look at drivers which only work on devices 
with vendor kernels. And they should consider the size of those drivers.

When kernel.org has dropped all the code in that category, then sure, 
let's worry about a few tiny old legacy drivers.
