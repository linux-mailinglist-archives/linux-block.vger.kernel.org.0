I spent around 4 hours with a spreadsheet and git. It would be cool if
that work could be automated. It's not always clear from the commit
heading that a commit is a fix. When it is clear that it is a fix, it
might not be clear what is fixed. I had to look at the diff quite a few
commits.

There is some work mentioning the ratio of memory safety issues fixed in
the kernel, but none of them go into details for specific subsystems as
far as I know. 20% of bugs fixed in stable Linux Kernel branches for
drivers are memory safety issues [1]. 65% of recent Linux kernel
vulnerabilities are memory safety issues [2]

As mentioned elsewhere in this thread there are other benefits from
deploying Rust than provable absence of memory safety issues.
