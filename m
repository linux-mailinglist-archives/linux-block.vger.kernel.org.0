Thanks, Keith!  

Is this flag influced at all when /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler is set 
to "none", or does the write_cache flag operate independently of the 
selected scheduler?

Does the block layer stop sending flushes at the first device in the stack 
that is set to "write back"?  For example, if a device mapper target is 
writeback will it strip flushes on the way to the backing device?

This confirms what I have suspected all along: We have an LSI MegaRAID 
SAS-3516 where the write policy is "write back" in the LUN, but the cache 
is flagged in Linux as write-through:

	]# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/write_cache 
	write through

I guess this is the correct place to adjust that behavior!
