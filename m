Originally it is added to dispatch in blk_execute_rq_nowait() for each
request, but now we support plug for pt request, that is why I add the
bypass in blk_mq_dispatch_plug_list(), and just grab lock for each batch
given now blk_execute_rq_nowait() is fast path for nvme uring pt io feature.

Guang Wu and Yu Kuai should have, and I didn't succeed in reproducing
it by setting bfq & io.bfq.weight cgroup in my test VM.
