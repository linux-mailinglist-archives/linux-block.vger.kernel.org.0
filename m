Thanks for info! So I think I see what's going on. The two mounts race
like:

MOUNT1					MOUNT2
num = ioctl(LOOP_CTL_GET_FREE)
					num = ioctl(LOOP_CTL_GET_FREE)
ioctl("/dev/loop$num", LOOP_SET_FD, ..)
 - returns OK
					ioctl("/dev/loop$num", LOOP_SET_FD, ..)
					  - acquires exclusine loop$num
					    reference
mount("/dev/loop$num", ...)
 - sees exclusive reference from MOUNT2 and fails
					  - sees loop device is already
					    bound and fails

It is a bug in the scheme I've chosen that racing LOOP_SET_FD can block
perfectly valid mount. I'll think how to fix this...
