Here's how to verify that the bisection got a correct result.  First, 
do a git checkout of commit 09324d32d2a0, build the kernel, and make 
sure that it exhibits the problem.

Next, have git write out the contents of that commit in the form of a
patch (git show commit-id >patchfile), and revert it (git apply -R
patchfile).  Build the kernel from that tree, and make sure that it
does not exhibit the problem.  If it doesn't, you have definitely shown
that this commit is the cause (or at least, is _one_ of the causes).
