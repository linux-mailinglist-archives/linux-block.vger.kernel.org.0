The VDO dm target fails because it requires IO it receives to be split
as it advertised (8 sectors).

No, this is all about correctness.

Seems you're confining the definition of the possible stacking so that
the top-level device isn't allowed to have its own hard requirements on
IO sizes it sends to its internal implementation.  Just because the
underlying device can split further doesn't mean that the top-level
virtual driver can service larger IO sizes (not if the chunk_sectors
stacking throws away the hint the virtual driver provided because it
used lcm_not_zero).

Doesn't matter, it is about correctness.

We cannot stack up a chunk_sectors that violates requirements of a given
layer.
