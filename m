You don't explicitly mention what will happen with devices that don't 
support ATA-passthrough.  Presumably the ATA12 commands will simply be 
rejected and OPAL will not be enabled.

I think it might be better to split this into two patches: One adding 
the security driver flag in the USB drivers and one for the SCSI changes 
-- those can be added separately through the SCSI tree after the USB 
changes have been merged.

I'm not going to try to review the SCSI changes.

You need to add a corresponding entry to the usb-storage.quirks entry in 
Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt.
