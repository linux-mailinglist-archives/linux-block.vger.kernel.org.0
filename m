I don't think simplify is the right word here.  The code isn't in any
way simpler, it just is more efficient an shifts work from
scsi_stop_queue to scsi_internal_device_block and scsi_target_block.

But the whole transformation is very confusing to me even if it looks
correct in the end, and it took me quite a while to understand it.

I'd suggest to further split this up and include some additional
cleanups:

  1) remove scsi_internal_device_block and fold it into device_block
  2) move the scsi_internal_device_block in what was
     scsi_internal_device_block and now is device_block out
     of state_mutex (and document in the commit log why this is safe)
  3) remove scsi_stop_queue and open code it in the two callers, one
     of which currently wants nowait semantics, and one that doesn't.
  4) move the quiesce wait to scsi_target_block and make it per-tagset

How could host ever be NULL here?  I can't see why we'd want this
check.

Btw, as far as I can tell scsi_target_block is never called for
a device that is a target device.  It might be worth throwing in
another patch to remove support for that case and simplify things
further.
