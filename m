If we wire the ops up to the nvme target we'd need that.  But for now
I think the more useful case would be to use nvme as the underlying
devices for the scsi target that already has all the PR infrastructure
and helps to validate the interface.

Yeah.

Basically any dual ported PCIe SSD should support them, typically those
are the U.2 format factor ones found in servers or enclosures.
