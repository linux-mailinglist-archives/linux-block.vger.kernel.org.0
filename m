Maybe I could have been more clear: I was asking about blockdev's not char 
devs.  Of course there are many chardevs that are critical.

So same question, but for blockdev's alone:

Is there way to start with an empty namespace (no inherit), and only add 
devices to the namespace that you would like to provide to the container?

Then the user can start with that blockdev and slice it up however they 
wish.
