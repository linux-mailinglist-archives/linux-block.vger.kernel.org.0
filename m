Subject: [PATCH 0/2] bcache: two emergent fixes for Linux v5.2-rc5

Hi Jens,

Here are two emergent fixes that we should have in Linux v5.2-rc5.

- bcache: fix stack corruption by PRECEDING_KEY()
  This patch fixes a GCC9 compiled bcache panic problem, which is
  reported by Fedora Core, Arch Linux and SUSE Leap Linux users whose
  kernels are combiled with GCC9. This bug hides for long time since
  v4.13 and triggered by the new GCC9.
  When people upgrade their kernel to a GCC9 compiled kernel, this
  bug may cause the metadata corruption. So we should have this fix
  in upstream ASAP.

- bcache: only set BCACHE_DEV_WB_RUNNING when cached device attached
  There are 2 users report bcache panic after changing writeback
  percentage of an non-attached bcache device. Therefore I suggest
  to have this fix upstream in this run.

Thank you in advance for taking care of these two fixes.

Coly Li
