I'm having trouble following this conclusion.  Sure, we give our best
effort, but if "nothing is supported" then what are we even doing here?

Either we aim to support module unloading, or we don't.

If we do support it, "best effort" isn't a valid reason for nacking
fixes.

If we don't support it, but still want to keep it half-working for
development purposes, tainting on rmmod will make it crystal clear that
the system has been destabilized.
