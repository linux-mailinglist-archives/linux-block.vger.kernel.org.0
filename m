Hi Adam,

As we all know complexity is the enemy of reliability. BFQ is
complicated so I am hesitant to use BFQ in a context where reliability
is important. Additionally, the BFQ scheduler uses heuristics to detect
the application type. As became clear recently, there heuristics can be
misled easily and fixing this is nontrivial (see also
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20210521131034.GL18952@quack2.suse.cz/).
I want the application launcher to create one cgroup for foreground
applications and another cgroup for background applications. Configuring
different I/O priorities per cgroup is an easy and reliable approach to
communicate information about the application type and latency
expectations to the block layer.

Some database applications use buffered I/O and flush that data by
calling fsync(). We want to support such applications. So it seems like
we have a different opinion about whether or not an I/O priority should
be assigned to I/O that is the result of page cache writeback?

Thanks,

Bart.
