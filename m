On v2 series (which is effectively same as this one [it would be nice if 
we had per-patch versioning]), for hisi_sas_v3_hw we get about same 
performance as when we use the reply_map, about 3.0M IOPS vs 3.1M IOPS, 
respectively.

Without this, we get 700/800K IOPS. I don't know why the performance is 
so poor without. Only CPU0 serves the completion interrupts, which could 
explain it, but v2 hw can get > 800K IOPS with only 6x SSDs.

Thanks,
John
