Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Fixes for potential deadlock during reboot

Hi folks,

Recently during my for-4.3 testing, I observe some lockdep warnings for
potential deadlock during reboot the kernel. Such potential deadlocks
are very hard to trigger in real life, but fix them and make lockdep
happy is still worthy IMHO.

This series is an effort to fix the potential deadlock issues, since
they are not critical stability fixes, they won't be CCed to stable
mailing list.

Thanks in advance for any commnet or review.
