Oops, I knew I missed someone important....

For completely different reasons. The list_lru is aligned to the mm
zone architecture which only partitions memory management accounting
and scanning actions down into NUMA nodes. It's also a per-node
ordered list (LRU), and it has intricate locking semantics that
expose internal list locks to external isolation functions that can
be called whilst a lock protected traversal is in progress.

Further, we have to consider that list-lru is tightly tied to
memcgs.  For a single NUMA- and memcg- aware list-lru, there is
actually nr_memcgs * nr_nodes LRUs per list. The memory footprint of
a superblock list_lru gets quite gigantic when we start talking
about machines with hundreds of nodes running tens of thousands of
containers each with tens of superblocks.

That's the biggest problem with using a more memory expensive
structure for the list_lru - we're talking gigabytes of memory just
for the superblock shrinker tracking structure overhead on large
machines. This was one of the reasons why we haven't tried to make
list_lrus any more fine-grained that it absolutely needs to be to
provide acceptible scalability.

Sure, but there's a lot more to list_lrus than it being a "per-node
list".  OTOH, dlock_list is really nothing more than a "per-cpu
list"....

I certainly have, and I haven't been able to justify the additional
memory footprint of a dlock_list over the existing per-node lists.
That may change given that XFS appears to be on the theshold of
per-node list-lru lock breakdown at 64 threads, but there's a lot
more to consider from a system perspective here than just
inode/dentry cache scalability....
