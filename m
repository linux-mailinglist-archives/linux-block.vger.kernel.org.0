So debugfs is used to place these debug information instead of sysfs.

It's OK for user-space tools to search data from these files as long as these
tools don't expect these information to be stable. And the most possible user
of these files would be test programs, and if some user-space tools may truly
expect some stable information from the debugfs file, maybe we should move
these information from debugfs to sysfs file.
