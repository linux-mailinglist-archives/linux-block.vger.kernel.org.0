Yes, it's easily reproducible (should be reproducible on 5.13-rc as well).
Simple read/write I/O on a cold FS (rotational disk obviously) will crash
pretty much immediately; without it everything works fine, likely because the
bug (in the recent queue merging patches?) is never triggered due to the
accidentally-wrong time calculation.
Will gladly test your patch! :)
