But how do we know it's lockdep, rather than a use-after-free
manifested as lockdep?
A Significant portion of kernel bugs are caused by concurrency and can
manifest in different ways, e.g. these are not lockdep, or WARN, or
use-after-free, but rather a race in nature.

For example? Does not look to be true for WARN, BUG, KASAN,
"inconsistent lock state".

It's not possible to skip, say, BUG.
And if we skip, say, a use-after-free, how do we know we are not
making things worse? Because now we are running on corrupted memory,
so anything can happen. Definitely a stray lockdep report can happen,
or other way around not happen when it should...

What lockdep bug types do you mean? All?
In the examples above you can see at least "inconsistent lock state"
mixed with 2 other completely different bug types.

I don't know now what was the result, but for a single run these were
manifestations of the same root bug.
E.g. see below, that's UAF in fuse_dev_do_read vs WARNING in
request_end. request_end is also fuse. And you can see that a memory
corruption causing a random bug type, in this case WARNING, but can as
well be LOCKDEP.
