It _WAS_ the first version how we did. But Jens didn't agree with this:

"This doesn't look right in a user header, any user API should be 32-bit
and 64-bit agnostic."

My following explanation was not convinced, then I change all the
__u32, __u64 stuffs into unsigned int, and unsigned long.

Considering nvm-pages allocator works only for both register word and
physical address are all 64 bits width, unsigned long will exactly
match 64bit and unsigned int will exactly match 32bit, I am fine to
use any of the forms. Jens is the upper layer maintainer, I choose to
listen to him.

BCH_MAX_RECS is a consistent value, to indicate how many elements can
be stored in array recs[] from struct bch_nvm_pgalloc_recs.

The code is in the way as you expected. The 8KB pad forces struct
bch_nvm_pgalloc_recs to be
two 4K pages, which is an ordered size from the nvm-pages buddy allocator.


> Also, what is the size of the 'bch_nvm_pgalloc_recs' structure?

struct  bch_nvm_pgalloc_recs is exactly 8K. The header is inside the 8K
space.

In memory layout of struct bch_nvm_pgalloc_recs is

|<------------ 8K ----------->|
[header] [recs ...............]
         |<-- BCH_MAX_RECS -->|


So the code works same as your expectation.

It works as you expected. But I realize maybe the indent is misleading.
I should add a blank before offsetof(), like this,

163 #define BCH_MAX_OWNER_LIST                              \
164         ((sizeof(struct bch_owner_list_head) -          \
165           offsetof(struct bch_owner_list_head, heads)) /\
166          sizeof(struct bch_nvm_pages_owner_head))

It means (8K - header_size) / sizeof(struct bch_nvm_pages_owner_head).

Thanks for your review. I will update all addressed locations except for
the __u32/__u64 stuffs, because Jens
didn't want them.
