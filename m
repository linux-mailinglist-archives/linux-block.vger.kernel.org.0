Hi Ming,

We got around to testing your my_for_5.6_block branch (Xiang Chen 
actually took the v5 series and applied the following on top only:
block: deactivate hctx when running queue in wrong CPU core
Revert "block: deactivate hctx when all its CPUs are offline when run…)

and we get this:

Looks like the queues are not properly drained as we're getting a single 
IO timeout. I'll have a look when I get a chance.

Cheers,
