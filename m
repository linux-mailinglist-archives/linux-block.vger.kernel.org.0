Okay.

In that case you need to either return when you didn't get the lock or

- when obtaining the lock during probe() and remove() set a variable
   containing the current cpu number
- and reset that to e.g NR_CPUS before releasing the lock again
- in the shrinker callback do trylock, and if you didn't get the lock
   test whether the cpu-variable above is set to your current cpu and
   continue only if yes; if not, redo the the trylock
