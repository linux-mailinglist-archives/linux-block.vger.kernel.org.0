There are only two cases in which WORK_CPU_UNBOUND is applied:

1) single hw queue

2) multiple hw queue, and all CPUs in this hctx become offline

For 1), all CPUs can be found in hctx->cpumask.

The message means CPU hotplug race is triggered.

Yeah, there is big problem in blk_mq_hctx_notify_dead() which is called
after one CPU is dead, but still run this hw queue to dispatch request,
and all CPUs in this hctx might become offline.

We have some discussion before on this issue:

This way isn't correct, hctx->cpumask should be kept as sync with
queue mapping.

Thanks,
