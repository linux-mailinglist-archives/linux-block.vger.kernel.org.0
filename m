Just thinking out if I am a random reporter, I could
report the original symptom now because we face it,
but everyone has his own internal business or even
with limited kernel ability for example, in any
case, there is no such expectation to rush someone
into build a clean reproducer.

Nevertheless, I will take time on the reproducer, and
I think it could just add some artificial delay just
after device_add(). I could try anyway, but no rush.

The original report was
https://lore.kernel.org/r/43375218-2a80-4a7a-b8bb-465f6419b595@linux.alibaba.com/

I don't know, I think just because 6.6 is a relatively
newer kernel, and most userspace logic has retry logic
to cover this up.
