I looked into it, and while it seems doable I think this goes in the
wrong direction as it pushed the RCU knowledge into the callers.  I'd
rather get something like this series in ASAP, and then for 5.8 or 5.9
move the bdi pointer to the gendisk and stop re-registering it and thus
solve the problems root cause for real.
