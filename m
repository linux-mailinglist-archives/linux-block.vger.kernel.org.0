The parted command, used to list the partitions, will open the disk in RW mode which results in systemd-udevd re-reading the partitions. This will trigger the rescan partitions which will also delete and re-add the partitions. So, both iscsi logout processing and the parted (through systemd-udevd) will be involved in add/delete of partitions. In our case, the following sequence of operations happened (the iscsi device is /dev/sdb with partition sdb1):

So, this stale link is a result of the race condition in kernel between the systemd-udevd and iscsi-logout processing as described above. We are able to reproduce this even with latest upstream kernel.

BTW,  there is a newer version of this patchset:

IMO, that isn't a work-around, kernel shouldn't drop partitions if
partition table isn't changed. But Christoph thought the current approach
is taken since beginning of kernel, and he suggested to fix systemd-udev.
