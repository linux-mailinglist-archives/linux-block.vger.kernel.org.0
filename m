Hi Damien,

What if a device that supports I/O priorities (e.g. an NVMe device that 
supports configuring the SQ priority) and a device that supports command 
duration limits (e.g. a SATA hard disk) are combined via the device 
mapper into a single block device? Should I/O be submitted to the dm 
device with one of the existing I/O priority classes (not supported by 
SATA hard disks) or with I/O priority class IOPRIO_CLASS_DL (not 
supported by NVMe devices)?

Shouldn't the ATA core translate the existing I/O priority levels into a 
command duration limit instead of introducing a new I/O priority class 
that is only supported by ATA devices?

Thanks,

Bart.
