I've been asked to move this conversation to a public thread on the upstream email distros.

Background:

At ALPSS last month (Sept. 2024) Hannes and Christoph spoke with Chris and I about how they'd like to remove the 
request-interface from DMMP and asked if Red Hat would be willing to help out by running some DMMP/Bio vs. DMMP/req performance 
tests and share the results.The idea was: with some of the recent performance improvements in the BIO path upstream we believe 
there may not be much of a performance difference between these two code paths and would like Red Hat's help in demonstrating that.

So Chris and I returned to Red Hat and broached this subject here internally. The Red Hat performance team has agreed to work 
work with us on an ad hoc basis to do this and we've made some preliminary plans to build a test bed that can used to do some 
performance tests with DMMP on an upstream kernel using iSCSI and FCP. Then we talked to the DMMP guys about it. They have some 
questions and asked me discuss this topic in an email thread on linux-scsi, linux-block and dm-devel.

Some questions are:

What are the exact patches which make us think the BIO path is now performant?

Is it Ming's immutable bvecs and moving the splitting down to the driver?

I've been told these changes are only applicable if a filesystem is involved. Databases can make direct use of the dmmp device, 
so late bio splitting not applicable for them. It is filesystems that are building larger bios. See the comments from Hannes and 
Christoph below.

I think Red Hat can help out with the performance testing but we will need to answer some of these questions. It will also be 
important to determine exactly what kind of workload we should use with any DMMP performance tests. Will a simple workload 
generated with fio work, or do we need to test some actual data base work loads as well?

Please reply to this public thread with your thoughts and ideas.

Thanks,
