I actually intended it to be writable.

Sure, I've recently seen some academic work showing the benefits
of batching in tcp/ip based block drivers. The problem with the
approaches taken is that I/O scheduling is exercised deep down in the
driver, which is not the direction I'd like to go if we are want
to adopt some of the batching concepts.

I spent some (limited) time thinking about this, and it seems to
me that there is an opportunity to implement this as a dedicated
I/O scheduler, and tie it to driver specific LLD stack optimizations
(net-stack for example) relying on the commit_rq/bd->last hints.

When scanning the scheduler code, I noticed exactly the phenomenon that
this patchset is attempting to solve and Christoph referred me to it.
Now I'm thinking if we can extend this batching optimization for both
use-cases.

That is not necessarily the case at all.

You're mostly correct. This is exactly why an I/O scheduler may be
applicable here IMO. Mostly because I/O schedulers tend to optimize for
something specific and always present tradeoffs. Users need to
understand what they are optimizing for.

Hence I'd say this functionality can definitely be available to an I/O
scheduler should one exist.
