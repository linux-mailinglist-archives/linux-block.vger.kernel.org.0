Right, and the only reason the depth is set to 2 is to allow one for
merging purposes.

With just 2 requests, any sequence is going to be pretty limited :-).
My recommendation would be to just ignore bd->last and treat any
request as a standalone unit. Should make for easier code too, and
you won't have two different cases to handle.
