Actually I don't come up with this idea mostly for performance reason :) Just try to
simplify codes a bit:
1) In current implementation, ubdsrv will need to submit queue depth number of
sqes firstly, and ubd_ctrl_start_dev() will also need to wait all sqes to be submitted.
2) Try to make ubd_queue_rq simpler, it maybe just call one io_gen_cqe_direct().

No, I don't mean to remove COMMIT command, we still need io_uring async
command feature to support ubd COMMIT or GETDATA command.

I have another concern that currently there are may flags in ubd kernel or
ubdsrv, such as:
#define UBDSRV_NEED_FETCH_RQ (1UL << 0)
#define UBDSRV_NEED_COMMIT_RQ_COMP (1UL << 1)
#define UBDSRV_IO_FREE (1UL << 2)
#define UBDSRV_IO_HANDLING (1UL << 3)
#define UBDSRV_NEED_GET_DATA (1UL << 4)

Some of their names looks weird, for example UBDSRV_IO_FREE. I think
more flags may result in more state machine error.
