Hi Keith,

How about recording the time at which the firmware upgrade finished and
making nvme_timeout() return RESET_TIMER if either a firmware upgrade is
in progress or if it has finished less than (request timeout) seconds
ago? The reason I'm asking this is because I'm concerned that the
patches you posted would need a careful review to see whether or not
these trigger new race conditions.

Thanks,

Bart.
