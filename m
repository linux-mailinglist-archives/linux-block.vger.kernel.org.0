Certainly.  Obviously on any host handling any kind of sensitive data 
there is a likelihood that sensitive data may be present in the vmcore, 
as such I more than happy to create a vmcore, I'm assuming this will 
create a kernel version of a core dump ... with 256GB of RAM (most of 
which goes towards disk caches) I'm further assuming this file can be 
potentially large.  Where will this get stored should the capture be 
made?  (I need to ensure that the filesystem has sufficient storage 
available)

Done.  Had to enable a few extra kernel options to get all the other 
requirements, so scheduled a reboot to activate the new kernel. This 
will happen on Saturday morning very early.

Possible to send from sysrq at the keyboard?  Otherwise I'll just need 
to set up the RMI, will just be easier to do this from the keyboard if 
possible, it's not always if it's left too late.

I'd prefer you let me know what you need ... security concerns and all 
... frankly, I highly doubt there is any data that is really so 
sensitive that it can be classified as "top secret" but we do have NDAs 
in place prohibiting me from sharing anything that may potentially 
contain customer related data ...

Kind regards,
Jaco
