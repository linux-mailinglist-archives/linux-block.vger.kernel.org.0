How can this even be a problem for f2f2 upsteam where f2fs must only
have a single write per zone outstanding?  I really don't want crap
in the block layer to work around a known broken model (multiple
outstanding WRITE commands per zone) that because it's so known broken
isn't even merged upstream.
