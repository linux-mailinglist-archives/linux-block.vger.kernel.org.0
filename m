Yes, if you call blk_queue_rq_timeout with 0, then the command will
timeout almost immediately. I added a check for this in the first patch.

If blk_mq_tag_set.timeout is 0, blk_mq_init_allocated_queue uses the
default 30 second value.

So with the patch if the user sets the timeout to 0, then we will just
log a message every 30 seconds that the command is stuck.

Ok.
