Forget to mention, trying to predicate the last request via allocating
tag for next request can't avoid extra .commit_rqs() because this
indirect call is always called when the rq list isn't done.

Also no matter .last is set or not, every implementation of .commit_rqs
always grabs one lock, so looks this patch can get real win without any
performance loss.

On the other side, .commit_rqs() can be avoided iff the last queued(successful)
rq is marked as .last, and the cost is to keep current estimate on .last.
However, why is .commit_rqs() required? Why doesn't .queue_rq() handle the batching
submission before non-STS_OK is returned? And the inline handling can be quite
efficient because one more spin lock acquire can be avoided usually. Then
.commit_rqs() can be killed.


Thanks,
Ming
