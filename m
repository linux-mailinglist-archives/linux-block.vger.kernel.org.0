I agree, the elevator flags as is, currently don't work for giving
hints from lower block layers. However, I still think it would be
worth exploring the idea that is brought up here.

The point is, even if it's perfectly fine to use kyber for MMC/SD, for
example, it would make little sense as BFQ performs better on this
type of single queue storage device. So, why solely rely on userspace
udev rules, when we can, in-kernel, help to decide what is the best
configuration?

Kind regards
