As Bart said, I did most of the work in 2022.

I also added a small dm target in the series that converts a non-po2
device to a po2 device to support existing FS without modifications
until native support is added in them.

One of the main arguments against the support was the fragmentation it
may cause in the FS world for zoned devices. Given that F2FS already
supports non-po2 devices, it is only btrfs that will need some work to
have native non-po2 support.

I would be more than happy to provide my reviews if someone wants to do
a respin on that series. IIRC, the changes to the block layer were not
very intrusive.
