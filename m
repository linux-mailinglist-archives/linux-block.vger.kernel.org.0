The information to make those decisions are in a zone's attributes, and thus applications would pull those, it would also know the writeable capability of a zone. So, all in all, creating support for NPO2 is something that takes a lot of work, but might have little to no impact on the overall software design.

Thanks for the clarification. I can attest that we are giving the
guarantee to simplify the host stack. I believe we are making many
assumptions in Linux too to simplify ZNS support.

This said, I understand your point. I am not developing application
support. I will refer again to Bo's response on the use case on where
holes are problematic.

Which is fine, as the customers anyway uses this in their own way, and don't need the Linux kernel support.

Ask things become stable some might choose to push support for certain
features in the Kernel. In this case, the changes are not big in the
block layer. I believe it is a process and the features should be chosen
to maximize benefit and minimize maintenance cost.

True. But this was the main constraint for PO2.

>2. Bo mentioned that the software already manages holes. It took a bit of time to get right, but now it works. Thus, the software in question is already capable of working with holes. Thus, fixing this, would present itself as a minor optimization overall. I'm not convinced the work to do this in the kernel is proportional to the change it'll make to the applications.

I will let Bo response himself to this.

>3. I'm happy to hear that. However, I'll like to reiterate the point that the PO2 requirement have been known for years. That there's a drive doing NPO2 zones is great, but a decision was made by the SSD implementors to not support the Linux kernel given its current implementation.

Zone devices has been supported for years in SMR, and I this is a strong
argument. However, ZNS is still very new and customers have several
requirements. I do not believe that a HDD stack should have such an
impact in NVMe.

Also, we will see new interfaces adding support for zoned devices in the
future.

We should think about the future and not the past.

Exactly.

Patches in the block layer are trivial. This is running in production
loads without issues. I have tried to highlight the benefits in previous
benefits and I believe you understand them.

Support for ZoneFS seems easy too. We have an early POC for btrfs and it
seems it can be done. We sign up for these 2.

As for F2FS and dm-zoned, I do not think these are targets at the
moment. If this is the path we follow, these will bail out at mkfs time.

If we can agree on the above, I believe we can start with the code that
enables the existing customers and build support for butrfs and ZoneFS
in the next few months.

What do you think?
