If we have that case for forced module unload a WARN_ON is the right thing.
That being said we can simply do the cmpxchg based protection for that
case as well if you want to keep it.  That will lead to a spurious
loop remove failure with -EBUSY when a concurrent force module removal
for cryptoloop is happening, but if you do something like that you get
to keep the pieces.

Well, split that into a cleanup patch if you think it is worth the
effort, with a good changelog.  Not really part of the bug fix.
