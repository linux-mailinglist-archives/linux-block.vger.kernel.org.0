Note that in scsi_alloc_sdev(), sdev default queue depth is set to 
shost->cmd_per_lun. Slightly different for ATA devices - see 
ata_scsi_dev_config().

There is then also the scsi_host_template.change_queue_depth() callback 
for SCSI hosts can use to set this.

The host HW is limited by the amount of simultaneous commands it can 
issue, regardless of where these tags are managed.

And you seem to be assuming in this equation that all users will own a 
subset of host tags, which is not true.
