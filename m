OK, thank you for the info!

Then the big question is "how long do the SRCU readers run?"

If all of the readers ran for exactly the same duration, there would be
little point in having more than one srcu_struct.

If the kernel knew up front how long the SRCU readers for a given entry
would run, it could provide an srcu_struct structure for each duration.
For a (fanciful) example, you could have one srcu_struct structure for
SSDs, another for rotating rust, a third for LAN-attached storage, and
a fourth for WAN-attached storage.  Maybe a fifth for lunar-based storage.

If it is impossible to know up front which entry has what SRCU read-side
latency characteristics, then the current approach of just giving each
entry its own srcu_struct structure is not at all a bad plan.

Does that help, or am I off in the weeds here?

							Thanx, Paul
