It would be meaningful if more than queue_max_discard_segments() bio's

Here I was considering normal write/read bio's, since I first took it =

that normal write/read IOs would be optimal in raid456, and finally =

that those 4k IOs can only be merged into not-so-big requests.

Many thanks for looking into this issue.
