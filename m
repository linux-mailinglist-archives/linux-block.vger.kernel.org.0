It is the dm-default-key driver, a driver about which everyone
(including the authors of that driver) agree that it should disappear.
Unfortunately the functionality provided by that driver has not yet been
integrated in the upstream kernel (encrypt filesystem metadata).

How that driver (dm-default-key) works is very similar to how dm-crypt
works. I think that the most important difference is that dm-crypt
requests encryption for all bios while dm-default-key only sets an
encryption key for a subset of the bios it processes.

The source code of that driver is available here:
https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android16-6.12/drivers/md/dm-default-key.c

Backtraces do not fully explain what happens because a single function 
(__submit_bio_noacct()) processes bios for multiple levels in a stacked
block driver hierarchy. That's why I added debug code that reports the
disk name (sde) for the first bio that is inserted out-of-order. This
output shows that the bio reordering is the result of bio splitting at
the bottom of the stack.

Thanks,

Bart.
