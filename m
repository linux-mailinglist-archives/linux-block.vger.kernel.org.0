IIUC this patch is essentially a band-aid to get back to the scalability that was possible before persistent grant support was added. Ultimately the right answer should be to get rid of persistent grants support and use grant copy, but such a change is clearly more invasive and would need far more testing.

Right, similar problems from other backends are possible.

This patch is also based on a common callback, namely the shrinker callback
system.  As the shrinker callback is designed for the general memory pressure
handling, I thought this is a right one to use.  Other backends having similar
problems can use this in their way.
