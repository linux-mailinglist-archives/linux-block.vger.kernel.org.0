Is this anything to do with what's on my mind as a database guy? I've 
heard that things like RAID and LVM have difficulty providing write 
barriers.

I want to be confident that, at EVERY level of the stack, I can put a 
barrier in that guarantees that everything written by user-space BEFORE 
the barrier is handled before anything written AFTER the barrier. That 
way, I can be confident that, after a problem, I know whether I can 
safely roll the log forward or back.

Cheers,
Wol
