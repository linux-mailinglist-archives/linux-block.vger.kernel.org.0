there are a couple more, but again I would understand if those are
deemed not important enough to keep it.

device emulation of (non-ZNS) SSD block device
die control: yes endurance groups would help but I am not aware of any
vendor supporting it
finer-grained control: 1000's of open blocks vs. a handful of
concurrently open zones
OOB area: helpful for L2P recovery
