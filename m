How about this, We consider link list as a whole, and any IO among them
that has drain will mark the first IO as drain, which is easy to implement.
Of course, there is no clear order between IO in link list and IO in defer_list,
so there maybe have a problems. 

If we want to keep a clear order between link list and defer_list, maybe need to
add more flags and variables. my initial implementation is very complicated. 
do you have any good idea?

First idea patch like follow. untested, just a idea.
