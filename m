I'm not sure I understood you.

The storage daemons I mentioned normally kick off N threads per M
devices. The threads handle duties like IO and error handling for those
devices. Those threads would set the flag, so those IO/error-handler
related operations do not end up writing back to them. So it works
similar to how storage drivers work in the kernel where iscsi_tcp has an
xmit thread and that does memalloc_noreclaim_save. Only the threads for
those specific devices being would set the flag.

In your case, it sounds like you have a thread/threads that would
operate on multiple devices and some need the behavior and some do not.
Is that right?
