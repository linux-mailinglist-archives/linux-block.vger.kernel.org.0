Isn't the posted patch simple enough for fixing the whole issue?

Not only in lines of code, but also in principle.

So far q->debugfs_dir is used by elevator, rq_qos, blktrace and blk-mq
debugfs.

The 1st three can have same lifetime with gendisk, but blk-mq debugfs
more share same lifetime with request_queue.

That is why I make ->debugfs_dir sharing same lifetime with request
queue since request queue has longer lifetime than gendisk.

With this way, we can clean the mess for delaying to add blk-mq debugfs.

Not mention this approach can allow us to add debugfs support for
non-disk request queue.

SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE is just one example, and there can be more from
/dev/sg or kernel. As one user of trace tool, it is important to get
intact request trace.

Please write one workable patch following your idea, then compare yours
and this patch, then you will see which one is simpler.
