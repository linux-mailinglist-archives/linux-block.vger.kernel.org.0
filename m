BTW, I wrote one link-grp-cp.c liburing/example which is based on sqe group,
and keep QD not changed, just re-organize IOs in the following ways:

- each group have 4 READ IOs, linked by one single write IO for writing
  the read data in sqe group to destination file

- the 1st 12 groups have (4 + 1) IOs, and the last group have (3 + 1)
  IOs


Run the example for copying two block device(from virtio-blk to
virtio-scsi in my test VM):

1) buffered copy:
- perf is improved by 5%

2) direct IO mode
- perf is improved by 27%
