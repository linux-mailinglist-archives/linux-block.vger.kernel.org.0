Will do.

About the goto, I don't know if backwards gotos in general are frowned
upon.  There are plenty of examples
in the kernel source.  This particular label, 'again' for instance:

$ grep -r again: mm/|wc -l
22
$ grep -r again: block/|wc -l
4

But, just because others have done it doesn't mean I should.  So, I
will attempt to explain why I think this is a good idea.
If I were to write this as a for-loop, it will look like this:

for (i = 0; i == 0 || (run_again && i < 2); i++) {
/* another level of 8 character wide indentation */
    run_again = false;
   /* a bunch of code that possibly sets run_again to true
}

if (run_again)
    blk_mq_run_hw_queue(hctx, true);

[Another alternative is to set run_again to true, and simplify the for-loop
condition to run_again && i < 2.  But, again, lots of verbiage and a boolean
in the for-loop condition.]

The for-loop is far from idiomatic.  It's not clear what it does when
you first look at it.
It distracts from the common path of the code, which is something that
almost always
runs exactly once.  There is now an additional level of indentation.
The readers of the
code aren't any better off, because they still have to figure out what
run_again is and if
they care about it.  And the only way to do that is to read the entire
body of the loop, and
comments at the top of the functions.

The goto in this case preserves the intent of the code better.  It is
dealing with an exceptional
and unusual case.  Indeed this kind of use is not unusual in the
kernel, for instance to deal
with possible but unlikely races.

Just my $0.02.
