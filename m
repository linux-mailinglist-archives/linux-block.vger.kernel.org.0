What other per-CPU kthreads even exist?

Documentation/core-api/atomic_ops.rst makes it pretty clear that the
special smp_mb__before_atomic and smp_mb__after_atomic barriers are only
used around the set_bit/clear_bit/change_bit operations, and not on the
test_bit side.  That is also how they are used in all the callsites I
checked.

Buy yes, even if not that would take care of it.

True.
