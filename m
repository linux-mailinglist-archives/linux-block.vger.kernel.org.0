You are absolutely right, that needs to be fixed.

Not saying it absolutely warrants a new one, and it could I guess sit in
the core, but this attempts to optimize for a specific metric while
trading-off others, which is exactly what I/O schedulers are for,
optimizing for a specific metric.

Not sure we want to build something biases towards throughput on the
expense of latency into the block core. And, as mentioned this is not
well suited to all device types...

But if you think this has a better home, I'm assuming that the guys
will be open to that.

Yes I agree, didn't see the local results. Probably some
misunderstanding or a typo, I'll let them reply on this.
