We will be doing a mix of checks/behavior. Maybe we want to settle on one?

It seems the code, before my patch, would let you do a open() then do a
nbd_genl_disconnect. This function would then try to cleanup what it
could and return success.

To keep the current behavior/style in nbd_disconnect_and_put would you
want to do:

nbd_disconnect_and_put()

....

if (nbd->task_recv)
       flush_workqueue(nbd->recv_workq);

?

Alternatively, I think if we want to make it so calling
nbd_genl_disconnect is not allowed on a device that we have not done a
successful nbd_genl_connect/nbd_start_device call on then we want to add
the new state bit to indicate nbd_start_device was successful.

Or, we could stick to one variable that gets set at start and always use
that to indicate nbd_start_device was called ok. For example, for
nbd_genl_reconfigure we already check if task_recv is set to check if
nbd_start_device was called successfully.
