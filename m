Hi Jens,

Thanks for looking into this :-)

It is because the probability of the lock contention on 
dc->writeback_lock
depends on the I/O speed backing device. From my observation during the
tests, for fast backing device with larger cache device, its writeback
thread may work harder to flush more dirty data to backing device, the
lock contention happens more and longer, so the writeback rate update
kworker has to wait longer time before acquires dc->writeback_lock. So
its dc->retry_max should be larger then slow backing device.

Therefore I'd like to have a tunable per-backing-device retry_max. And
the syses interface will be added when users/customers want it. The use
case is from SAP HANA users, I have report that they observe the soft
lockup warning for dc->writeback_lock contention and worry about whether
data is corrupted (indeed, of course not).

I response inline for the following suggestion.

The reason I didn't place '!set_at_max_writeback_rate' with other items 
in
previous if() was for the above code comment. If I moved it to previous
if() without other items, I was not comfortable to place the code 
comments
neither before or after the if() check. So I used a separated if() check 
for
'!set_at_max_writeback_rate'.

 From your change, it seems placing the code comments behind is fine (or
better), can I understand in this way? I try to learn and follow your 
way
to handle such code comments situation.

The incremental reschedule delay was to avoid might-be-useless retry, 
but
the above method works too. Just setting the default retry_max from 5 to
15, for 10 more retry with 5 seconds interval, it's fine. I can modify
the change in this way to recuse change size.

Aha, this is cool! I never though of using do{}while(0) and break in 
such a
genius way! Sure I will use this, thanks for the hint :-)

After you reply my defense of dc->retry_max, and the question of code
comments location, I will update and test the patch again, and re-sbumit 
to
you.

Thanks for your constructive suggestion, especially the do{}while(0) 
part!
