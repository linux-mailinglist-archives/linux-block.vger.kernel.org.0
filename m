Hi Jens,

This is the first wave bcache patches for Linux v5.12.

It is nice to see in this round we have 3 new patch contributors:
Jianpeng Ma, Qiaowei Ren and Kai Krakow.

In this series, the EXPERIMENTAL patches from Jianpeng Ma, Qiaowei Ren
and me are initial effort to store bcache meta-data on NVDIMM namespace.
The NVDIMM space is managed and mapped via DAX interface, and accessed
by linear address. In this submission we store bcache journal on NVDIMM,
in future bcache btree nodes and other meta data will be added in too,
before we remove the EXPERIMENTAL statues.

Dongdong Tao contributes a performance optimization when
bcache cache buckets are highly fregmented, Dongdong's patch makes the
dirty data writeback faster and from his benchmark reprots such changes
have recognized improvement for randome write I/O thoughput and latency
for highly fregmented buckets, and no regression for regular I/O
observed.

Kai Krakow contributes 4 patches to offload system_wq usage to separated
btree_io_wq and bch_flush_wq. In his environment the daily backup job
throughput increases from 60.2MB/s to 419MB/s and accomplished time
reduced from 14h29m to 2h13m.

Joe Perches also contributes a fine code stype fix which I pick for this
submission.

Please take them for Linux v5.12 merge window.

Thank you in advance.
