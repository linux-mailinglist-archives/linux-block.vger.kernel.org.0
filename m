Hi Ming,

So I got around to doing some testing. The good news is that issue which 
we were experiencing in v3 series seems to have has gone away - alot 
more stable.

However, unfortunately, I did notice some SCSI timeouts:

15508.615074] CPU2: shutdown
[15508.617778] psci: CPU2 killed.
[15508.651220] CPU1: shutdown
[15508.653924] psci: CPU1 killed.
[15518.406229] sas: Enter sas_scsi_recover_host busy: 63 failed: 63

[15518.455899] sas: sas_eh_handle_sas_errors: task 0x000000009f77c9bd is

A couple of things to note:
- I added some debug prints in blk_mq_hctx_drain_inflight_rqs() for when 
inflights rqs !=0, and I don't see them for this timeout
- 0 datarate reported from fio

I'll have a look...

Thanks,
John
