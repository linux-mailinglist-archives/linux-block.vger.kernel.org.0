Hi Jens,

Can't honestly say - I'm not following any other user forum than 
linux-m68k (and that's not really a user forum either).

In all fairness, it was a pretty broken design, but it did at least 
work. I concede that it was unmaintainable in its old form, and still 
largely is, just surprised that I didn't see a call for testing on 
linux-m68k, considering the committer realized it probably wouldn't work.

I've used it quite a bit in the past, but not for many years. For legacy 
hardware, floppies are often the only way to get data on or off the 
device, and I consider this driver an important fallback option should 
my network adapter (which is a pretty horrible kludge to use an old ISA 
NE2000 card on the ROM cartridge port) fail.

But then, any use of this legacy hardware is an exercise in curiosity 
mostly.

Thanks, tried that - that does indeed cause multiple requests queued to 
the driver (which rejects them promptly).

Now fails because ataflop_commit_rqs() unconditionally calls 
finish_fdc() right after the first request started processing- and 
promptly wipes it again.

What is the purpose of .commit_rqs? The PC legacy floppy driver doesn't 
use it ...

Cheers,

	Michael
