Thank you very much confirming my concern.

So maybe it's me not checking the md-bitmap code carefully enough to
expose the full picture.

Unfortunately, we only go allocation for the RAID56 chunks. In side a
RAID56 the underlying devices still need to go the regular RAID56 full
stripe scheme.

Thus the btrfs RAID56 is still the same regular RAID56 inside one btrfs
RAID56 chunk, but without bitmap/journal.

For the resync part is where btrfs shines, as the extra csum (for the
untouched part) and metadata COW ensures us only see the old untouched
data, and with the extra csum, we can safely rebuild the full stripe.

Thus as long as no device is missing, a write-intent-bitmap is enough to
address the write hole in btrfs (at least for COW protected data and all
metadata).

Adding Neil into this thread. Any clue on the existing
md_bitmap_startwrite() behavior?

Thanks,
