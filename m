Hi Bart,

But can you mention why we made to changes from v3 onwards (versus v2)?

The v2 patch just used SRCU as the sync mechanism, and the impression I 
got from Jens was that the marginal performance drop was tolerable. And 
the issues it tries to address seem to be solved. So why change? Maybe 
my impression of the performance drop being acceptable was wrong.

Thanks,
John

Ps. I have been on vacation for some time, so could not support this work.
