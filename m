Hi Christoph,

Can you clarify this? Isn't the goal of the rq->mq_ctx = data->ctx 
assignment in blk_mq_rq_ctx_init() to ensure that the same blk_mq_ctx is 
used during I/O submission? As you know blk_mq_rq_ctx_init() is called 
immediately after a tag has been allocated.

I can wait until Jens has queued your patch series.

Thanks,

Bart.
