Yes, disk_force_media_change has that general problem back from the
early Linux days (it had a different name back then, though).  I think
it is because traditionally removable media in Linux never had
partitions, e.g. the CDROM drivers typically only allocated a single
minor number so they could not be scanned.  But that has changed because
the interfaces got used for different use cases, and we also had
dynamic majors for a long time that now allow partitions.  And there
are real use cases even for traditional removable media, e.g. MacOS
CDROMs traditionally did have partitions.

Maybe we can just drop the CHANGE_FD ioctl and see if anyone screams?
