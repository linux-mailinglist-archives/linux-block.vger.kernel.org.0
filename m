That's why it's an RFC - while it's not the prettiest, the ->ki_complete
assigner is also the one that sets IOCB_ALLOC_CACHE, and hence it's not
that hard to verify that it does IOCB_PUT_CACHE correctly too. That
said, I would prefer a better way of passing the bio back. There are
other optimizations that could be done if we do that. But I have no good
ideas on how to do the passing differently right now.
