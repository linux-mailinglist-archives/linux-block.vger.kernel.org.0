Even though the block layer is not usually exposed in the same way that
something like the USB stack is, absence of memory safety bugs is a very
useful property. If this is attainable without sacrificing performance,
it seems like a nice option to offer future block device driver
developers. Some would argue that it is worth offering even in the face
of performance regression.

While memory safety is the primary feature that Rust brings to the
table, it does come with other nice features as well. The type system,
language support stackless coroutines and error handling language
support are all very useful.

Regarding maintenance of the bindings, it _is_ an amount extra work. But
there is more than one way to structure that work. If Rust is accepted
into the block layer at some point, maintenance could be structured in
such a way that it does not get in the way of existing C maintenance
work. A "rust keeps up or it breaks" model. That could work for a while.

Best regards
Andreas
