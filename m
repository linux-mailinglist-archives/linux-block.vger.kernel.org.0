I have retested this latest version, and it seems the scaling issue has
been fixed at the first glance.

Test results with the latest version:
3-threads  dm-stripe-3 targets  (12k randread IOPS, unit K)
317 -> 409 (iodepth=128)

Compared to the test results of v1:
3-threads  dm-stripe-3 targets  (12k randread IOPS, unit K)
313 -> 349 (iodepth=128, kfifo queue depth =128)
313 -> 409 (iodepth=32, kfifo queue depth =128)
314 -> 409 (iodepth=128, kfifo queue depth =512)
