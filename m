FYI, you'll cringe if you open the latest upstream
drivers/dm/dm-bufio.c  Mikulas made heavy use of BUG_ONs. Because of
that Joe started working a code that was setting him up for
persecution (and me by association for allowing it in to begin with).

Good news, the dm-6.4-dev branch I point to below already addresses
many of the historic and new BUG_ONs.

Was just an oversight. The code has had quite some review internally
at Red Hat. But we've been focused on ensuring the code stable. Case
of not seeing the forest from the trees... *shrug*  But nice catch,
appreciate it.

It should. And I've started to do it. I was trying to avoid making
Joe do it after the fact. And I loathe to do it.  It is developing in
reverse, it sucks (but I'm hopeful Joe has the work split out in old
devel trees, will check with him Monday).

For this specific code, the issue is that while the code changes are
split logically between:
1) LRU with clock algorithm
2) DM buffer cache manager
They are pretty tightly coupled (I see no point trying to implement
1 without 2 just to check a review box... it's thankless make-work,
100% so if nobody actually reviews the code that closely). Wanting
code to always be in that form isn't wrong, but it is very much a
suspect requirement if the evolution needs to be recreated in
post-mortum fashion.

And then having reviewers take time to understand various intermediate
transformations the code might go through to reach the final result
isn't necessarily a good use of reviewers' time.

BUT I _have_ already split out commits like this:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/commit/?h=dm-6.4-dev&id=8de2bc47d6ed5f96855e6262eb928a59e8a2a9cb

And if you look at the broader changes I made tonight in this
dm-6.4-dev tree you'll see I'm taking your review feedback seriously:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/log/?h=dm-6.4-dev

You'll hear from me with a v3 of this patchset next week.

Mike
