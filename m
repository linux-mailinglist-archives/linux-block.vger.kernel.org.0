blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues() is called after nvme_wait_freeze
returns, nothing changes here, so correctness wrt. updating hctx
mapping is provided.

The only difference is that in-tree code starts to freeze
at the beginning of error recovery, which way can just prevent new IO,
and old ones still are queued, but can't be dispatched to driver
because of quiescing in both ways. With this patch, new IOs queued
after error recovery are just like old ones canceled before resetting.

So not see problems from driver side with this change, and nvme
driver has to cover new IOs queued after error happens.


Thanks.
