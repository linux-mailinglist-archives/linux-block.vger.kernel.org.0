Hmm. That really is curious; typically existing devices will not be 
reassigned. Especially not if they are in use by something.
And the FC layer is going into quite some lengths to prevent this from 
happening.
So this really looks more like an issue with how exactly this 'adding 
new block device' step was done.

As I said, this typically does not happen.
It would need closer examination to figure out what really happened.

Which is what we try ...

Suddently changing the order of LUNs is _not_ what is supposed to 
happen. This really sounds more like an issue with NetApp.
