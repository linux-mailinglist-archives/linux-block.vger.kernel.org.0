Unfortunately it is not.  Your very argument is what made be believe
that considering busy queues was enough, in the first place.  But, as
I found out, the problem is caused by the queues that do not enjoy
idling.  With your patch (as well as in my initial version) they are
not counted when they remain without requests queued.  And this makes
asymmetric scenarios be considered erroneously as symmetric.  The
consequence is that idling gets switched off when it had to be kept
on, and control on bandwidth is lost for the victim in-service queues.

Thanks,
Paolo
