No. And you wrote this code, so I'd expect you to know this:
bio_for_each_segment_all() can _not_ return a pointer into the original
bvec table, it has to synthesize bvecs - same as regular
bio_for_each_segment() - because it has to break bvecs up into
individiual pages.

There was zero benefit to the way you were doing it, you were just
adding pointer access to something that was on the caller's stack.

Based on _what_?

Code size doesn't change, as I already showed hch. What's your claim?
