Which should have been done before submitting a patch like this.

It's a bad look of entitlement when complaints are made about everything
not being served on a silver platter. The service has been useful to me,
and it was useful in this particular case. Can it be improved? Surely,
everything can, and this one is a bit more rough around the edges than
the intel build bot. Which, coincidentally, has been around for many
years, so hardly surprising. This one triggered quickly, the intel bot
sometimes takes _days_ to produce anything. Improvements can be made in
both cases.

And _I_ was the one that CC'ed you on the report, as it was your commit
that broke the build, not the bot. Nobody got auto-harassed here.
