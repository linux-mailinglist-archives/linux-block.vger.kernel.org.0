START_DEV calls add_disk(), and STOP_DEV calls del_gendisk(), but if 
GD_OWNS_QUEUE is set, blk_mq_exit_queue() will be called in
del_gendisk(), then the following START_DEV will stuck.

If blk_mq_exit_queue is called in del_gendisk() for scsi, how can
re-bind work as expected since it needs one completely workable
request queue instead of partial exited one?
