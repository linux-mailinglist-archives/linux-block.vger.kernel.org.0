I don't know bcache that well, but I didn't see anything obviously
putting links in the bdev dir when I last looked. It did look like it
created some links between its own sysfs dirs, but maybe I
misinterpreted the code.

I don't think that any other fs with its own /sys/fs/ presence (i.e.,
XFS, ext4, btrfs) does this sort of thing, so I'm a little skeptical of
the idea that userspace currently needs it (not necessarily that it
couldn't use it for the better in the future).

Ok, but that sounds contradictory to what the block layer folks want.

I dunno, it seems to me that the notions of better general coordination
between /sys/block and /sys/fs and that of bcachefs' current behavior
being wrong are not mutually exclusive things. But I'll just leave it
alone until there's some more clarity here..
