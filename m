Hi Jens,

Could you please consider take the v12 series for Linux v5.15 merge window?

In this version the full pointer in the on-media data structures are
modified to per-namespace offset, and all previous review comments are
fixed.
There is no more comments for 4 hours, and this series survives in my
smoking test for 24+ hours, as an EXPERIMENTAL code the current status
is fine IMHO.

Thanks in advance.

Coly Li
