I had to look for that, because it obviously didn't complain for me.
Looks like it's the one in drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c which changes
from PTR_ERR() to using 'err' which is indeed an int.

I think you're overreacting here. I *always* test these pulls, it's run
through the test box with the tests there, and it's always running on my
laptop a day or two in advance. Typing it right now from that branch.
Stop making it sound like it's not being tested at all, according to the
above it obviously never saw a compiler which is just blatantly untrue.

I obviously missed a *warning* because I don't have any way to test that
part and it's not part of my config. Hardly seems like a shootable
offense. I have to defer to the maintainer there, which did ack this
patch.

This is all fixes and innocous changes otherwise. My suggestion here
would be:

1) You pull it, change that rnbd mistake at merge time.
2) I queue a patch on top with that single change.

Let me know what you prefer, and can we please tone down the aggression
here?
