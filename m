I'm not saying the patch is wrong or not doing what it says. What caught
my attention was the fact that the admin capabilities is not that
different from requiring the read permissions. Which for a block device
is not easy to get. Normally block devices have 0660 and group is
'disk', so yeah I can add a monitoring daemon to the group. But that
still would allow it to read all block devices.

So yeah, the patch is making it easier but from my POV it's not that
practical. A more fine grained access control would be needed, or
another way how to read just the zone info. Reading the information from
eg. sysfs has it's own issues.
