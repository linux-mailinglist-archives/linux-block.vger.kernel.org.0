Many thanks to those who have submitted topics for the Maintainers
Summit and to the Kernel Summit track at the Linux Plumber's
Conference.

We have extended the deadline for Kernel Summit proposals by a week,
to June 23.  If you have something that you would like to share with
the kernel development community as a technical topic, or something
you'd like to porpose as a Maintainers Summit topic, please submit
your proposal in the next week!

Many thanks,

						- Ted
