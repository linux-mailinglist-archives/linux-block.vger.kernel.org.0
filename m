That is expected behavior for this RT case, given userspace won't submit
IO from isolated CPUs.

That is intentional change, given no IO will be submitted from 4-7
most of times in RT case, so it is fine to select effective CPU from
isolated CPUs in this case. As peter mentioned, IO may just be submitted
from isolated CPUs during booting. Once the system is setup, no IO
comes from isolated CPUs, then no interrupt is delivered to isolated
CPUs, then meet RT's requirement.

We can document this change somewhere.

In short, if there is at least one housekeeping available in the
interrupt's affinity, we choose effective CPU from housekeeping CPUs.
Otherwise, keep the current behavior wrt. selecting effective CPU.

With this approach, no interrupts can be delivered to isolated CPUs
if no IOs are submitted from these CPUs.

Please let us know if it addresses your concerns.


Thanks,
Ming
