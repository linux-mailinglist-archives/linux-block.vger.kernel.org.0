Aha! I overlooked the for loop ends with the entity's class here and not
after the full range of classes.

Yes, you're working within the "order" of the entity's class and it's
always the last, i.e. least too, so the scale is 1.

Actually, can it ever happen that the higher class leaves some tags for
the lower? (IOW, is the CLS_wsum anytime exceeding sum of all active
entities of the CLS at the given point in time?) (1)

Can it happen that bfqq_request_over_limit() is called for a BE entity
before calling it for an RT entity (more precisely, not the
bfqq_request_over_limit() calls but actual allocation of tags)? (2)

I assume this implies the answer to my previous question (2) is "yes"
and to the question (1) is: "numerically no, but lower class entity can
take some tags if it gets to draw them earlier".

I see there's no point using the same values for the weights in the
bfqq_request_over_limit() calculations as bfq_ioprio_to_weight()
calculates given the nature of strict ordering of classes above each
other. Your scoring makes sense to me now.
