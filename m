It looks like you missed a few places. There's a long prev_state in
sched/core.c::finish_task_switch() for instance.

I suppose that's where coccinelle oughta help but I'm really not fluent
in that. Is there a way to make it match p.state accesses with p task_struct?
And if so, can we make it change the type of the variable being read from
/ written to?

How did you come up with this changeset, did you pickaxe for some regexp?
