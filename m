Many of the storage layer messages are using printk, not dev_printk.

I believe these examples are using dev_printk.  With dev_printk we don't
need to parse the text, we can use the meta data.

I'm trying to get something that's works for journalctl.

Did you miss in my example where it's currently a printk?  I showed what
it would look like if it was a dev_printk.

Journald is using _KERNEL_DEVICE to add the _UDEV_DEVLINK information to
the journal entry, it's not parsing the prefix of the message.

The above json is outputted from journalctl when you specify "-o
json-pretty".

Again, I'm not trying to keep anyone out of the loop.  Last I knew the
meta data capability wasn't being removed, maybe this has changed?

IMHO one of the root problems is that many storage messages are still
using printk.  Changing messages to dev_printk has been met with resistance.

To me the problem today is the kernel logs information to identify how a
storage device is attached, not what is attached.  I think you agree
with this statement.  The log information is not helpful without the
information to correlate to the actual device.  I think you also agree
with this too as you have mentioned it's user space's responsibility to
collect this so that the correlation can be done.

If the following are *both* true, we have a usable message that has the
correlated data with it in the journal.

1. The storage related kernel message goes through dev_printk
2. At the time of the message being emitted the device symlinks are present.

When those two things are both true, journalctl can do the following
(today):

$ journalctl /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5002538844584d30


However, it usually can't because the above two things are rarely both
true at the same time for a given message for journald when it logs to
the journal.

You keep saying this is a user space issue, but I believe we still need
a bit of help from the kernel at the very least by migrating to
dev_printk or something similar that adds the same meta data without
changing the message text.

Yes, my patch series went one step further and added the device ID as
structured data to the log message, but I was also trying to minimize
the race condition between the kernel emitting a message and journald
not having the information to associate it to the hardware device.

If people have other suggestions please let them be known.

Again, I'm sorry I didn't reach out to the correct people.  Hopefully
I've CC'd everyone that is appropriate for this discussion.


Thanks,
Tony
