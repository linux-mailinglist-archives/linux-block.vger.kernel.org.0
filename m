Recently I've been looking at some issues we are seeing in the field with customers
that have very large storage configurations with lots and lots of SAS drives. We are seeing scenarios
where drive head failures and other issues are resulting in command aborts that then ultimately fail
and we then quiesce the HBA in order to do the LUN reset. Since this configuration has
hundreds of SAS disks under a single HBA, that results in a very noticeable I/O service time
problem for all the other disks under that HBA due to one misbehaving drive. We've so far
focused most our efforts on getting other components in the stack to behave differently
in order to mitigate the issue. However, that doesn't mean we can't do better
in the kernel. 

The direction this patch set was headed was to implement async LUN reset, something we've
discussed for years, but never fully implemented.  Is this something anyone else is still
seeing as an issue for them in other environments? Given that the last attempt at implementing
this, from what I can tell, happened now three years ago and then stalled, I'm afraid
I know the answer, but is anyone actively working on anything like this?

Thanks,

Brian
