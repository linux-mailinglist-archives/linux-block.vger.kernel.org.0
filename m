Subject: Re: [PATCH v2] Do not require atomic writes to be power of 2 sized
 and aligned on length boundary

What does "just the kernel atomic write rules" mean?
What's the idea of these restrictions?
I want to use atomic writes, but without this restriction.
And generally I don't think this restriction is needed for anyone at all.
That's why I ask - can it be removed? Can I remove it in my patch?
