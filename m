As you well know, ANA is decoupled from multipathing in the NVMe spec.
This fix illustrates that the existing Linux NVMe ANA handling is too
tightly coupled with native NVMe multipathing. Unfortunately, you've
forced this as a means to impose your political position:

And while this is largely irrelevant to the technical review of my fix:
native nvme-multipath may be the only supported option in your world. In
mine that isn't true and never has been.

Your political posturing doesn't replace technical justification. You
don't have a compelling technical case to take the stance you do, yet
you guard it like you do. Just a really stark inconsistency in your
technical leadership that is repeatedly left unchecked by others.

Alas.
