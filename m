Also for NVMe we initially went down the road to try to support
non power of two sizes.  But there was another major early host that
really wanted the power of two zone sizes to support hardware based
hosts that can cheaply do shifts but not divisions.  The variable
zone capacity feature (something that Linux does not currently support)
is a feature requested by NVMe members on the host and device side
also can only be supported with the the zone size / zone capacity split.

I don't think we even need a new target for it.  I think you can do
this with a table using multiple dm-linear sections already if you
want.

Agreed. Supporting non-power of two sizes in the block layer is fairly
easy as shown by some of the patches seens in this series.  Supporting
them properly in the whole ecosystem is not trivial and will create a
long-term burden.  We could do that, but we'd rather have a really good
reason for it, and right now I don't see that.
