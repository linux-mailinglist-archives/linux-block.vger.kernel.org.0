I don't doubt you have a good reason to want it, I'm just not clear on why an
initramfs isn't an option?  You have this special kernel with your special
option, and you manage to get these things to boot your special kernel right?
So why is a initramfs with a tiny nbd-client binary in there not an option?

Also I mean that there are a bunch of different nbd servers out there.  We have
our own here at Facebook, qemu has one, IIRC there's a ceph one.  They all have
their own connection protocols.  The beauty of NBD is that it doesn't have to
know about that part, it just does the block device part, and I'd really rather
leave it that way.  Thanks,

Josef
