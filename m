`GenDisk` is not in scope, so short link is not working. But I can do
whatever this is called:


//! - Create a [`GenDisk<T>`], passing in the `TagSet` reference
...
//! [`GenDisk<T>`]: gen_disk::GenDisk

Would you prefer that?

`TagSet` was linked above. Would you link it on each mention?

I would love if `rustfmt` would do this. But I think it is both unstable
and broken for examples like this [1]. I'll fix it up by hand.

How do you manage formatting in examples? By hand?

I was considering the layout not being deterministic for `repr(Rust)`. I
think that in practice it will be the case that the two types will have
the same layout, but I could not find the documentation that states
this. Nomicon does not talk about zero sized types [2].

No particular reason. I should probably move it.

This had me scratch my head for a bit. I run `make rustfmt` and `make
rustfmtcheck`, so I had no idea why my code would be formatted
incorrect. It took me a while to figure out that we are not enabling
`comment_width =3D 100`, presumably because it is an unstable `rustfmt`
feature. I am not sure what the correct way to enable it but I hacked
the Makefile and enabled it. It gives a huge diff all across the kernel
crate.

So, it seems we _are_ in fact using 80 line fill column, since that is
what much of our existing code is using, and that is what the build
system is configured to use.

Where did you come across the 100 character fill column?

Anyways, we should configure our tools to the standard we want. I don't
care if it's 80 or 100, as long as I can have the tools do the job for
me.

Let's discuss this at next meeting.

Copy pasta probably. Will remove.

I would agree. But we had a bit of discussion at LSF about naming things
differently in Rust vs C. C people prefer if we keep the C names, even
if they do not make sense to the people who write the new Rust code.

In C, the vtable entry is called `complete_callback` and the called
symbol is usually `my_driver_complete_rq`.

We could go with `completed`, `completed_callback`, or `complete_rq`.
Although `completed` sounds like it should return a bool indicating
whether the request was already completed.

I think I'll leave it for now, and we can always change it if we come up
with a really good name.

I can understand why you are confused. `Request::complete` is in my
outgoing patch queue. There is no way to call this function in this
patch. I will move it to a later patch. Thanks.

I think guaranteeing at least a null character is always written by
`write_str` is a good thing. It is used for writing C strings to device
name fields. `write_str` with a zero size buffer would give undesirable
results, and is probably not what the caller wants.

I considered a `UniqueARef` but it would just move the error handing to
`ARef::into_unique` and then make `end_ok` infallible.

There are four states for a request that we need to track:

A) Request is owned by block layer (refcount 0)
B) Request is owned by driver but with zero `ARef`s in existence
   (refcount 1)
C) Request is owned by driver with exactly one `ARef` in existence
   (refcount 2)
D) Request is owned by driver with more than one `ARef` in existence
   (refcount > 2)

It is in the doc comments for `RequestDataWrapper` as well.

We need A and B to ensure we fail tag to request conversions for
requests that are not owned by the driver.

We need C and D to ensure that it is safe to end the request and hand back
ownership to the block layer.

I will ping you when I hook up the NVMe driver with this.

The refcount is zero after `try_set_end`, so there is no owner of the
count. The request will be in state A and thus block layer owns the
request. Block layer does not honor this refcount, it is only for the
driver to know.

Perhaps I should move the explanation up into the docs for `Request`.

It will eventually wrap private data associated with the request. Those

It looks like it! Except this function is returning the updated value,
`fetch_update` is returning the old value.

Would you rather that I rewrite in terms of the library function?

Both options sound good. Ofc the first one sounds more user friendly
while the latter one sounds easier to implement. Getting rid of the
unsafe blocks here would be really nice.
