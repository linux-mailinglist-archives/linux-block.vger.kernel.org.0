Okay, but how do you use that information in practice?

That's an analyses we run frequently as well: we see high pressure,
and then correlate it with the events.

High rate of refaults? The workingset is too big.

High rate of compaction work? Somebody is asking for higher order
pages under load; check THP events next.

etc.

This works fairly reliably. I'm curious what the extra per-event
latency breakdown would add and where it would be helpful.

I'm not really opposed to your patches it if it is, I just don't see
the usecase right now.
