Ming -

Update from my testing. I found only one case of IO stall. I can discuss
this specific topic if you like to send separate patch. It is too much
interleaved discussion in this thread.

I noted you mentioned that V4 of 'scsi: core: only re-run queue in
scsi_end_request() if device queue is busy' need underlying support of
"scsi: core: run queue if SCSI device queue isn't ready and queue is idle"
patch which is already reverted in mainline.
Overall idea of running h/w queues conditionally in your patch " scsi:
core: only re-run queue in scsi_end_request" is still worth. There can be
some race if we use this patch and for that you have concern. Am I
correct. ?

One of the race I found in my testing is fixed by below patch -

diff --git a/block/blk-mq-sched.c b/block/blk-mq-sched.c
index 54f9015..bcfd33a 100644
--- a/block/blk-mq-sched.c

                if (!sbitmap_any_bit_set(&hctx->ctx_map))
                        break;

-               if (!blk_mq_get_dispatch_budget(hctx))

BLK_MQ_BUDGET_DELAY);
                        break;
+               }

                rq = blk_mq_dequeue_from_ctx(hctx, ctx);
                if (!rq) {


In my test setup, I have your V3 'scsi: core: only re-run queue in
scsi_end_request() if device queue is busy' rebased on 5.8 which does not
have
"scsi: core: run queue if SCSI device queue isn't ready and queue is idle"
since it is already reverted in mainline.

I have 24 SAS SSD and I reduced QD = 16 so that I hit budget contention
frequently.  I am running ioscheduler=none.
If hctx0 has 16 IO inflight (All those IO will be posted to h/q queue
directly). Next IO (17th IO) will see budget contention and it will be
queued into s/w queue.
It is expected that queue will be kicked from scsi_end_request. It is
possible that one of the  IO completed and it reduce sdev->device_busy,
but it has not yet reach the code which will kicked the h/w queue.
Releasing budget and restarting h/w queue is not atomic. At the same time,
another IO (18th IO) from submission path get the budget and it will be
posted from below path. This IO will reset sdev->restart and it will not
allow h/w queue to be restarted from completion path. This will lead one
IO in s/w queue pending forever if there are no more new IOs.
blk_mq_sched_insert_requests
	->blk_mq_try_issue_list_directly().

I found that overall idea and attempt in recent block layer code is to
restart h/w queue from submission path in delayed context.
Making it less dependent on queue restart from completion path and/or even
though completion path restart the queue, there are certain race in
submission path which must be fixed by self-restarting h/w queue.

If we catch all such instances in submission path (as posted above in my
patch), we can still consider your patch
'scsi: core: only re-run queue in scsi_end_request() if device queue is
busy'.
