What is the user-visible result of splitting IO at 128 sectors?

I understand it isn't related with correctness, because the underlying
queue can split by its own chunk_sectors limit further. So is the issue
too many further-splitting on queue with chunk_sectors 8? then CPU
utilization is increased? Or other issue?

I guess gcd() won't be better because gcd(a,b) is <= max(a, b), so bio
size is decreased much with gcd(a, b), and IO performance should be affected.
Maybe worse than min_not_zero(a, b) which is often > gcd(a, b).


Thanks,
