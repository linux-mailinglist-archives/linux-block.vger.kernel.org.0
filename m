Igor, Javier,

both of you are right. Here is what I came up with after some more thinking=
.

We can avoid the races in 2. and 3. with the following two invariants:
I1: If we have a GC line with seq_id X, only garbage collect from
lines older than X (this addresses 2.)
I2: Guarantee that the open GC line always has a smaller seq_id than
all open user lines (this addresses 3)

We can enforce I2 by adding a minor seq_id. The major sequence id is
only incremented when allocating a user line. Whenever a GC line is
allocated we read the current major seq_id (open user line) and
increment the minor seq_id. This allows us to order all GC lines
before the open user line during recovery.

Problem with this approach:
Consider the following example: There exist user lines U0, U1, U2
(where 0,1,2 are seq_ids) and a non-empty GC5 line (with seq_id 5). If
we now do only sequential writes all user lines will be overwritten
without GC being required. As a result, data will now reside on U6,
U7, U8. If we now need to GC we cannot because of I1.
Solution: We cannot fast-forward the GC line's seq_id because it
contains old data, so pad the GC line with zeros, close it and open a
new GC9 line.

Generality:
This approach extends to schemes that use e.g. hot, warm, cold open
lines (adding a minor_minor_seq_id)
