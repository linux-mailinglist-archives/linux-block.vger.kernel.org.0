Stop this idiocy.

Warnings are fatal. Deal with it. If you think it's ok to have
warnings in your code, go do another project.

The -Werror addition is not new, it's a policy that has been in place
for a decade or so. I just got fed up with people not noticing
warnings and using that as an excuse for their broken code.

The fact is, apparently -Werror _did_ find it, and the people involved
just never bothered to even tell upstream about it, so that two weeks
afterwards I got a TERMINALLY BROKEN pull, request.

Don't make excuses about "it wasn't that broken".

It was broken. Own it.

And something went very very wrong for that breakage to have stayed
around and then being pushed to me.

I want whatever went wrong in that process fixed. Why did you make a
pull request to Jens, and then never notified him about the problems
in it?
