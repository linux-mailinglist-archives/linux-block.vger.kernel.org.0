So this is an old/now EOL 9300 series HBA, right ? Or is this a 3008 controller
chip as part of the server motherboard (e.g. a supermicro HBA ?)
Looking at the Broadcom support page for legacy products, the latest FW version
seems to be 16.00.10.00.

I do not have this FW... Not sure what the HBA itself is too. I only have some
Broadcom 9300-XX HBAs that have the 3008 controller.

This one had a FW update last month or so. So checking the latest is required.

I have these. I will try to check. But again, I seriously doubt this has
anything to do with the drives since these do not support CDL, nor do the HBAs
you listed. None of then support CDL so calling scsi_report_opcode() for
checking CDL, we should always see the HBA SAT return "CDL not supported".

Probably a timing difference since these drives are not the same generation.
They have different timing on scan.

Broadcom ? Would you care to comment ?

At this point, I have no idea what is going on. My hunch is that it is the HBA
SAT misbehaving. But that is only a hunch. To prove it, we would likely need a
bus trace and have Broadcom look at HBA logs (which can be extracted using
storecli). All of this likely means involving the technical support of the vendors.
