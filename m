Hi Jens,

The first wave bcache change for Linux v5.11 is quite silent. Most of
the development is not ready for this merge window. The only change in
this submission is from Dongsheng Yang, this is his second contribution
which catches a very implict bug and provides a fix. The patch runs on
his environment for a while and takes effect.

Please take it for v5.11. Thank you in advance.

Coly Li
