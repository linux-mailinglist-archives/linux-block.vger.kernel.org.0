Okay, I didn't question this approach when it first went through, so
sorry about this digression, but I really don't get how this DNR check
helps at all.

The code currently returns an error if DNR is set. Based on the commit
messages, it sounds like you need that error to skip comparing
identifiers through nvme's scan_work calling revalidate_disk():
suppressing the error has revalidate_disk() fail with -ENODEV when
comparing identifiers fails.

Since we do return the error when DNR is set, we skip comparing
identifiers and return blk_status_to_errno(nvme_error_status(ret))
instead. How is that errno an improvement?

And then if DNR is not set, we suppress the error and proceed with
comparing identifiers??
