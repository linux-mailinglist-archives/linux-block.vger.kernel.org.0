I'll defer to Martin, but I think we still need the integrity_interval
naming in some form.

static inline unsigned short queue_logical_block_shift(struct  request_queue *q)

I don't think a NULL queue makes any sense here.  And I'd rather
ensure the field is always set rather than adding a conditional here.

And btw, centrelize in the Subject should be centralize.
