Hello,

Computational storage creates the way to offload as user data as =
metadata processing into storage space. So, I would like to discuss the =
feasibility of building a storage device that is capable of synthesizing =
a file system by itself.

First of all, it is well known that designing and implementing a file =
system architecture is a very time-consuming and difficult process. Also =
this process includes a significant amount of debugging and bug fix =
efforts. But real life and evolving technologies require much faster =
data processing. So, file system technologies cannot satisfy the =
challenges of real life very frequently. Generally speaking, if =
computational storage is capable of designing and evolving file system =
architecture under I/O load then it could be a very interesting =
solution.

Any machine learning approach is based on training by input data. So, =
I/O requests can be such training data. It is possible to imagine a ML =
engine inside of computational storage that can analyze the requests to =
store and to retrieve the data and to build the file system=E2=80=99s =
metadata structures on the fly. Generally speaking, computational =
storage can implement a file system architecture inside of a storage =
device without any preliminary development of a file system driver.

Initially, the ML engine inside of computational storage could be =
equipped with the initial set of metadata structure primitives (array, =
queue, bitmap, tree). By receiving I/O requests, ML engine can use at =
first the simplest metadata structures and to gather the =
modification/access statistics. For example, initially, it is possible =
to use a simple array of extents to account file=E2=80=99s content =
location. Then, with a growing amount of statistics, ML engine can =
synthesize more sophisticated and efficient metadata structures and =
start to use, for example, a tree that consumes existing arrays as =
tree=E2=80=99s nodes. As a result, a file system can be constructed by =
an ML engine taking into account the peculiarities of files=E2=80=99 =
lifetime and workload.

Any opinions related to this crazy idea?

Thanks,
Slava.
