Agreed.

This would mean that it may be suboptimal for nvme-tcp to complete
requests in softirq context from the network context (determined by
NIC steering). Because in this case, this would trigger workqueue
schedule on a per-request basis rather than once per .data_ready
call like we do today. Is that correct?

It has been observed that completing commands in softirq context
(network determined cpu) because basically the completion does
IPI + local complete, not IPI + softirq or IPI + workqueue.

Agree.
