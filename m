Subject: [PATCH V2 00/13] block: don't drain file system I/O on del_gendisk

Hello,

Draining FS I/O on del_gendisk() is added for just avoiding to refer to
recently added q->disk in IO path, and it isn't actually reliable:

1) queue freezing can't drain FS I/O for bio based driver, so blk-cgroup
shutdown can't be moved into del_gendisk()

2) freezing queue can't drain in-progress IO issue/dispatch activities,
so elevator shutdown can't be moved into del_gendisk()

3) the added flag of GD_DEAD may not be observed reliably in
__bio_queue_enter() because queue freezing might not imply rcu grace
period.

4) passthrough IO accounting code can refer to q->disk after disk is
released

When releasing disk, all FS IOs are guaranteed to be done, so this
patchset tries to shutdown elevator/blk-cgroup/rq qos there, then
referring to q->disk can be avoided after disk is released.

Also add flag of BLK_MQ_REQ_USER_IO for accounting passthrough IO
only if the IO is from userspace, since disk is live for user
passthrough IO.

V2:
	- take new approach to make current referring to q->disk reliable
