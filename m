We use the NVDIMM name space as memory, and from our testing and
observation, the DAX mapping base address is consistent if the NVDIMM
address from e820 table does not change.

And from our testing and observation, the NVDIMM address from e820
table does not change when,
- NVDIMM and DRAM memory population does not change
- Install more NVDIMM and/or DRAM based on existing memory population
- NVDIMM always plugged in same slot location and no movement or swap
- No CPU remove and change

For 99.9%+ time when the hardware working healthily, the above condition
can be assumed. Therefore we choose to store whole linear address
(pointer) here, other than relative offset inside the NVDIMM name space.

For the 0.0?% condition if the NVDIMM address from e820 table changes,
because the last time DAX map address is stored in ns_start of struct
bch_nvm_pages_sb, if the new DAX mapping address is different from
ns_srart value, all pointers in the owner list can be updated by,
    new_addr = (old_addr - old_ns_start) + new_ns_start

The update can be very fast (and it can be power failure tolerant with
carefully coding) for. Therefore we decide to store full linear address
for directly memory access for 99%+ condition, and update the pointers
for the 0.0?% condition when DAX mapping address of the NVDIMM changes.

Handling DAX mapping address change is not current high priority task,
our next task after this series merged will be the power failure tolerance
of the owner list (from Intel developers) and storing bcache btree nodes
on NVDIMM pages (from me).

Thanks for your comments and review.
