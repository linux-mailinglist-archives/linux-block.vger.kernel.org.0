blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() can be run on another request queue just
between one driver tag is allocated and updating the request map, so one
extra request reference still can be grabbed.

So looks only holding one queue's usage_counter doesn't help this issue, since
bt_for_each() always iterates on driver tags wide.

IMO there isn't real difference between the two iteration.
