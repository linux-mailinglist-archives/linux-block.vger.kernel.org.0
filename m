Hannes didn't actually justify why he added chunk_sectors to
blk_stack_limits:

Likely felt it needed for zoned or NVMe devices.. dunno.

But given how we now have a model where block core, or DM core, will
split as needed I don't think normalizing chunk_sectors (to the degree
full use of blk_stack_limits does) and than using it as basis for
splitting makes a lot of sense.
