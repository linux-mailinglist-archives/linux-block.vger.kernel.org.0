If that's the case, then make it clear that you don't expect it to
be merged right now. As it stands, when you sent it out, all I know is
that it's an issue that's crashing current kernels, and we're winding
down this release. Hence there's a sense of urgency there, as we
could be releasing this kernel as soon as this weekend.

If you have a potential fix, but it isn't tested yet, then make that
clear by submitting it as an RFC. You'd say something like:

"This is a potential fix for X/Y/Z, let's wait for the original reporters
to verify this before including it."

And make that clear with RFC in the subject line. Your patch had none
of that, in fact it said:

[PATCH BUGFIX]

and the commit message had no references to this needing any further
testing.
