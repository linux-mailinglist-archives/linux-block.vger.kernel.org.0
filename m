Hmm. I think this is irrelevant,

Yes, this should work,

I don't think so.

Yes. Again, unless wakeup was spurious and this needs another trivial fix.

If we can't rely on this then this code is simply broken?

I can't understand this logic, but I can't argue. However, in this case I'd
suggest the patch below instead of this series.

If rq_qos_wait() does the unnecessary acquire_inflight_cb() because it can
hit a case we didn't think was possible, then why can't it do on the first
iteration for the same reason? This should equally fix the problem and
simplify the code.

In case it is not clear: no, I don't like it. Just I can't understand your
logic.

And btw... again, I won't argue, but wq_has_multiple_sleepers is badly named,
and the comments are simply wrong. It can return T if wq has no sleepers, iow
if list_empty(wq_head->head). 2/2 actualy uses !wq_has_multiple_sleepers(),
this turns the condition back into list_is_singular(), but to me this alll
looks very confusing.

Plus I too do not understand smp_mb() in this helper.

Oleg.
