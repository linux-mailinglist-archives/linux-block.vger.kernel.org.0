Ok you right, we should drop the group reference inside __bfq_bfqd_reset_in_service() 
as we do for queue's entities. Please see updated patch version.

Subject: [PATCH] block: bfq fix blkio cgroup leakage v2

commit db37a34c563b ("block, bfq: get a ref to a group when adding it to a service tree")
introduce leak forbfq_group and blkcg_gq objects because of get/put
imbalance. See trace balow:
-> blkg_alloc
   -> bfq_pq_alloc
     -> bfqg_get (+1)
->bfq_activate_bfqq
  ->bfq_activate_requeue_entity
    -> __bfq_activate_entity
       ->bfq_get_entity
         ->bfqg_and_blkg_get (+1)  <==== : Note1
->bfq_del_bfqq_busy
  ->bfq_deactivate_entity+0x53/0xc0 [bfq]
    ->__bfq_deactivate_entity+0x1b8/0x210 [bfq]
      -> bfq_forget_entity(is_in_service = true)
	 entity->on_st_or_in_serv = false   <=== :Note2
	 if (is_in_service)
	     return;  ==> do not touch reference
-> blkcg_css_offline
 -> blkcg_destroy_blkgs
  -> blkg_destroy
   -> bfq_pd_offline
    -> __bfq_deactivate_entity
         if (!entity->on_st_or_in_serv) /* true, because (Note2)
		return false;
 -> bfq_pd_free
    -> bfqg_put() (-1, byt bfqg->ref == 2) because of (Note2)
So bfq_group and blkcg_gq  will leak forever, see test-case below.

We should drop group reference once it finaly removed from service
inside __bfq_bfqd_reset_in_service, as we do with queue entities.

##TESTCASE_BEGIN:
#!/bin/bash

max_iters=${1:-100}
#prep cgroup mounts
mount -t tmpfs cgroup_root /sys/fs/cgroup
mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio
mount -t cgroup -o blkio none /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio

# Prepare blkdev
grep blkio /proc/cgroups
truncate -s 1M img
losetup /dev/loop0 img
echo bfq > /sys/block/loop0/queue/scheduler

grep blkio /proc/cgroups
for ((i=0;i<max_iters;i++))
do
    mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/a
    echo 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/a/cgroup.procs
    dd if=/dev/loop0 bs=4k count=1 of=/dev/null iflag=direct 2> /dev/null
    echo 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/cgroup.procs
    rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio/a
    grep blkio /proc/cgroups
done
##TESTCASE_END:
