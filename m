If a flush follows a series of writes, would it be best if the flush 
happened _after_ those writes complete?  Then then the storage medium will 
be sure to flush what was intended to be written.

It seems that this series of events could lead to inconsistent data:
	loop		->	filesystem
	write a
	write b
	flush
				write a
				flush
				write b
				crash, b is lost

If write+flush ordering is _not_ important, then can you help me 
understand why?
