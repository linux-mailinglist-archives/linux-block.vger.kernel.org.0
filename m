The limit is from commit 09324d32d2a0 ("block: force an unlimited segment
size on queues with a virt boundary") which claims to fix f6970f83ef79
("block: don't check if adjacent bvecs in one bio can be mergeable").

However commit f6970f83ef79 only covers merge code which isn't used by
bio driver at all, so not sure pre-6.9-rc is broken for stacking driver.

Also commit 09324d32d2a0 mentioned that it did not cause problem,
actually 64K default segment size limits always exists even though the
device doesn't provide one, so looks there isn't report as 'real bugs',
or maybe I miss something?

    block: force an unlimited segment size on queues with a virt boundary

    We currently fail to update the front/back segment size in the bio when
    deciding to allow an otherwise gappy segement to a device with a
    virt boundary.  The reason why this did not cause problems is that
    devices with a virt boundary fundamentally don't use segments as we
    know it and thus don't care.  Make that assumption formal by forcing
    an unlimited segement size in this case.
