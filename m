It's right this is wrong, I think this happened as following:

1) bfq_sync_bfqq_move() is introduced in commit 9778369a2d6c ("block,
bfq: split sync bfq_queues on a per-actuator basis"), which is merged to
for-6.3 branch.

2) commit 64dc8c732f5c ("block, bfq: fix possible uaf for 'bfqq->bic'")
is merged to mainline.

3) later, the fix for 2) b600de2d7d3a ("block, bfq: fix uaf for bfqq in
bic_set_bfqq()") is merged to mainline as well, however, I missed the
change in bfq_sync_bfqq_move() in for-6.3 brach.

4) At last, 1) is merged to mainline with some rebase, this is how
bfq_check_ioprio_change() is fixed, however, bfq_sync_bfqq_move() is
still problematic.

Thanks,
Kuai
