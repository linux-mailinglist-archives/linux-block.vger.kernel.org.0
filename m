Hm, I don't think this is actually true. blkfront cannot attach an
arbitrary number of devices, blkfront is just a frontend for a device
that's instantiated by the Xen toolstack, so it's the toolstack the one
that controls the amount of PV block devices.

That last sentence is hard to parse. I think something like:

"Because this commit is changing only the shrink limit but still uses the
same freeing mechanism it does not touch pages which are currently
mapping grants."

... to set the duration as a module parameter.

I assume pswpin means 'pages swapped in' and pswpout 'pages swapped
out'. Might be good to add a note to that effect.

I would argue that with a ~40MB/s throughput you won't see any
performance difference at all regardless of the size of the pool of
free pages or the amount of persistent grants because the bottleneck is
on the storage performance itself.

You need to test this using nullblk or some kind of fast storage, or
else the above figures are not going to reflect any changes you make
because they are hidden by the poor performance of the underlying
storage.

I would like to add that IMO this is papering over an existing issue,
which is how pages to be used to map grants are allocated. Grant
mappings _shouldn't_ consume RAM pages in the first place, and IIRC
the fact that they do is because Linux balloons out memory in order to
re-use those pages to map grants and have a valid page struct.

A way to solve this would be to hotplug a fake memory region and use
it in order to map grant pages, without having to balloon out RAM
regions. At the end of day on a PV domain mapping a grant should just
require virtual address space.

This is going to get even worse for PVH that requires a physical memory
address in order to map a grant, but that's another story.

unsigned?

You can likely drop the xen_blkif prefix since this is a static
variable.
