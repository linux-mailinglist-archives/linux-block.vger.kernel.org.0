Yes, holding cgroup ref from IO would be fine. But that is not really our
problem.

The problem is bfq_queue associated with a task effectively holds a
reference to the potentially dead cgroup and the reference can stay there
until the task (that itself got reparented to the root cgroup) exits. So I
think we need to reparent these bfq_queue structures as well to avoid
holding cgroup in zombie state excessively long.
