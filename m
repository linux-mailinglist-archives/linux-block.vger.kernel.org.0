I do know that problem ...

Yep, that means just that, with your specific workload, bandwidth
isolation gets guaranteed without idling.  So that's exactly one of
the workloads for which I'm suggesting my handling of a special case.

Thanks for your feedback. I'll consider submitting this change.

I agree.  What do you think of my suggestion for solving the problem?
Might you help with that?

Thanks,
