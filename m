If you do decide to write your proposal up as a patch, a description of the
topology would be helpful as well.

The proposed solution will provide us a way such that users who are benefited with CPU capacity check [1] would be able to use the fix as it is, and if a user (including us) want to bypass cpu capacity fix [1], they can set rq_affinity to 3 and would be able to retain performance drop as mentioned in first email. This would give flexibility to user to choose what's the best for their system.

FWIW I'd agree with introducing a new queue_flag that behaves like
QUEUE_FLAG_SAME_COMP before commit af550e4c9682 ("block/blk-mq: Don't complete locally if capacities are different").
Equal capacity makes sense as the default behavior for
QUEUE_FLAG_SAME_COMP, but is limiting, there might be just one
CPU of that capacity and that might be fully utilized by submission
(and related work), so completing locally makes sense.

So QUEUE_FLAG_SAME_COMP I'd leave as-is and introduce
QUEUE_FLAG_SAME_LLC that actually just checks LLC.

Christian
