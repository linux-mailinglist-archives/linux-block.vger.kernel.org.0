This thread is just for fixing one recent regression caused by queuing
FUA data into scheduler queue, and actually direct dispach has
been done for very long time, but I don't mean it is reasonable.

Is there linux kernel FUA read users? Just run a quick grep, seems FUA
is just used for sync write.

It shouldn't be hard to to queue FUA into scheduler, but details need to
consider, such as, if FUA can be merged with normal IO, maybe others.

Also do you have any test or benchmark result to support the change of
queuing FUA to scheduler?


Thanks,
