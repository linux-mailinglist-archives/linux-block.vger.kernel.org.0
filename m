Hi Damien,

Thank you for having explained in detail the scenario that you ran into.

I think what has been explained above is a scenario in which the filesystem
allocates requests per zone in another order than the LBA order. How about
requiring that the filesystem allocates and submits zoned writes in LBA order
per zone? I think that this is how F2FS supports zoned storage.

Thanks,

Bart.
