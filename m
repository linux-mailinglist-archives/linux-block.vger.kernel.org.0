Another thing with putting everything into single structure is that the
params structure will become a mess sooner or later, since all kinds of
parameters will be added at the end, none of them are related.

For example, Ziyang is working on userspace recovery feature which may
need some data which can't be hold in single bit flag, meantime someone
may work on zoned target implementation[1] which needs to send zoned
parameter, and I am planning to add backing pages for handling running
out of pages, which needs userspace to pre-allocate/send buffer to driver
as backing page[s], ... Then all these unrelated parameters are added at
the end, and the single structure becomes fatter and fatter, then become
unreadable and hard to maintain.
