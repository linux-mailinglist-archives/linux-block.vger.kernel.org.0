IMO, it is one bad hw/sw interface.

First such request has to be reserved, since all inflight IOs can be in error.

Second error handling needs to provide forward-progress, and it is supposed
to not require external dependency, otherwise easy to cause deadlock, but
here request from specific HW queue just depends on this queue's cpumask.

Also if it has to be reserved, it can be done as one device/driver private
command, so why bother blk-mq for this special use case?

No, it is really not OK, if all cpus in hctx->cpumask are offline, you
can't allocate
request on the specified hw queue, then the erroneous IO can't be handled,
then cpu hotplug handler may hang for ever.
