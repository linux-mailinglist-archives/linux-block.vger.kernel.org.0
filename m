I definitely agree. I first wanted to be sure the patches were acceptable
as a principle, but disambiguating the variables is easy to do now.

I could do it by hand, I did quite a bit of manual changes and checks
already and the driver is not that long.

OK, it's as you like. If you think you can do the change quickly, feel
free to do so, otherwise it should not take me more than one hour. In
any case as previously mentioned I still have the hardware in a usable
state if you want me to recheck anything.
