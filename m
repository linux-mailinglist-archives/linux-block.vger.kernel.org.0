First of all, thanks for keeping discussion, Luis.

That was the one I thought race between sysfs and during rmmod.

To me, the rmmod faillure is not a big problem for zram since it's
common cases in the system with -EBUSY(Having said, I agree that's the
best if we could avoid the fail-and-retrial. IOW, -EBUSY should be
last resort unless we have nicer way.)

That's the one I missed in this discussion. Now I am reading your [2/2]
in original patch. I thought it was just zram instance was destroyed
by sysfs race problem so you had seen the deadlock. I might miss the
point here, too. 

Hmm, we are discussing several problems all at once. I feel it's time
to jump v2 with your way in this point. You said three different
problems. As I asked, please write it down with more detail with
code sequence as we discussed other thread. If you mean a deadlock,
please write what specific locks was deadlock with it.
It would make discussion much easier. Let's discuss the issue
one by one in each thread.

This is the one I didn't understand.

Yub.

I second if it's general problem for drivers, I agree it's worth to
addresss in the core unless the driver introduce the mess. I have
no idea here since I didn't understand the problem, yet.

It would be good sign to propose general solution.

I agree with you that would be better but let's see how it could go
clean.

FYI, please look at hot_remove_store which also can remove zram
instance on demand. I am looking forward to seeing your v2.

Thanks for your patience, Luis.
