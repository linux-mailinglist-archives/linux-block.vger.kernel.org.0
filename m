Oh yes, sorry about this, I did it in the first series but forgot to
do it again. What checkpatch complains about is essentially lines which
slightly exceed 80 characters due to the macro expansions, while I tried
to limit the changes to the strict minimum. I guess that's OK to keep
future fixes easier to backport.

Thanks,
Willy
