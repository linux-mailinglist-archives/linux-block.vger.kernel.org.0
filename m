Ok. I see your point. I was thinking of the case where the multipath
bdev is also enabled so we would have the same name in different places
referring to a different device.

Would something like nvmeXnYc work here or your prefer something
different where we need to implement new, dedicated filters for
user-space? I thing you suggested nvmegXnY at some point?

Here, the naming would be for both the char device and the sysfs
entry.
