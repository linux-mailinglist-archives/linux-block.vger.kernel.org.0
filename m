Usually there is a space before '('. There are more instances throughout
the document.

This paragraph doesn't give specific reasons why userspace block devices
are "very helpful".

Userspace block devices are attractive because:
- They can be written many programming languages.
- They can use libraries that are not available in the kernel.
- They can be debugged with tools familiar to application developers.
- Crashes do not kernel panic the machine.
- Bugs are likely to have a lower security impact than bugs in kernel
  code.
- They can be installed and updated independently of the kernel.

I think including this list makes it clear why userspace block devices
are appropriate in certain cases.

Is "/dev/ublkbN" the same as "/dev/ublkb*"? Please use one term consistentl=

I think this sentence means "Therefore ublk uses io_uring passthrough
commands to implement userspace block devices in a performant way".

It might be worth separating two use cases:

- Quickstart and people who just want to use existing ublksrv
  functionality.

- Developers who are writing their own ublk server (e.g. rjones' nbdkit).

ublksrv isn't needed, it's possible to code directly against the ublk
driver UAPI. I think it's worth pointing this out so it's clear to
people when and why you would use ublksrv and also when to code against
the ublk driver UAPI.

The documentation currently leaves it to the reader to figure out that
ublksrv is just one possible userspace server implementation.

It may be clearer to say "the server" or "userspace" instead of
"ublksrv", since that is the name of a specific server implementation
and people may develop other servers.

I find it hard to understand this paragraph. It seems the
UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA command allows userspace to set up something
related to IO buffers. What exactly does this command do?

In the READ case userspace doesn't know exactly when the ublk driver is
done copying in the buffer. I guess this isn't a problem because the
userspace buffer will be reused when the next request is fetched?
