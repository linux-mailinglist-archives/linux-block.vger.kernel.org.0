The thing is that we don't like the cost of ebpf based solution. And FWIW,
two years ago, we had compared about ebpf solution and record those
data in kernel.

A. in-kernel monitor: 1~5% performance drop
B. ebpf monitor: 10~15% performance drop

Note, we even copied each bio in approach A, which means the performance
could be more better since we don't clone bio now.

And I think the major concern is about the additional Kconfig option, since
Jens doesn't like it, so I guess no need to make the change it in upstream
kernel.

Thanks,
Guoqing
