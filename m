I may be missing something obvious here, but if the lower layers split
to their desired boundary already, why does this limit need to stack?
Won't it also work if each layer sets their desired chunk_sectors
without considering their lower layers? The commit that initially
stacked chunk_sectors doesn't provide any explanation.
