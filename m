In my opinion, I wouldn't object if we would model this as phy, simply
because I think it would be the easiest way. Although, I agree, it's
not a perfect fit.

Please, no. As discussed and also pointed out by Arnd in another
thread, generic drivers must remain portable and must not get
sprinkled with SoC specific code. If not, we would be moving backwards
and increasing the fragmentation of the kernel.

The qcom case is about programming a crypto key, which seems rather
specific to me. I can't figure out another generic way to support
this, but using the SoC specific calls.

The Mediatek case is about turning on/off a resource to activate the
device. If the phy framework doesn't work for us (or another), then at
least we should fall back to use runtime PM + PM domain provider
(genpd), because this would solve the problem. SoC specific code, like
the SMC call can then be called from the genpd provider driver and
abstracted from generic drivers.

Additionally, in this case the mmc driver has already runtime PM
support deployed, which means some of the work has already been
completed.
