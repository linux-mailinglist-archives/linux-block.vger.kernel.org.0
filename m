Where are talking about the kernel/drivers/block/pktcdvd.ko.xz module. I have not used it directly, as it is a kernel module. Instead I have been working with
K3b, the KDE cdwriting software package.

Quite a lot actually, let's say I have written about 11 * 25 cd's / dvd's in total. Without any problems. They are all still readable too, even after all this
time (about ten years).

Very stable if you ask me. Flawless even.

No, no bugs in pktcdvd. No fixing to do whatsoever.

Yes we are, sort of. You can even have my pear. That's exactly the problem with your story :)

A DVD is 4Gb and Blueray goes all the way up to 100Gb, while a floppy disc is 1.44Mb. Who would want to write his backup files to 1.44Mb floppy disc these days?
