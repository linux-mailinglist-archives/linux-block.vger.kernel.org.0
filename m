I'm not asking about btrfs - I'm asking about actual, real world
problems reported in production XFS environments.

Yet we are not hearing about this, either. Nobody is reporting that
their data is being found to be corrupt days/weeks/months/years down
the track.

This is important, because software RAID5 is pretty much the -only-
common usage of BLK_FEAT_STABLE_WRITES that users are exposed to.
This patch set is effectively disallowing direct IO for anyone
using software RAID5.

That is simply not an acceptible outcome here.

So when XFS implements checksums and that implementation is
incompatible with Direct IO, then we can talk about disabling Direct
IO on XFS when that feature is enabled. But right now, that feature
does not exist, and ....

.... as you say, "nobody is using PI with XFS".

So patchset is a "fix" for a problem that no-one is actually having
right now.

Modifying an IO buffer whilst a DIO is in flight on that buffer has
-always- been an application bug.  It is a vector for torn writes
that don't get detected until the next read. It is a vector for
in-memory data corruption of read buffers.

Indeed, it does not matter if the underlying storage asserts
BLK_FEAT_STABLE_WRITES or not, modifying DIO buffers that are under
IO will (eventually) result in data corruption.  Hence, by your
logic, we should disable Direct IO for everyone.

That's just .... insane.

Remember: O_DIRECT means the application takes full responsibility
for ensuring IO concurrency semantics are correctly implemented.
Modifying IO buffers whilst the IO buffer is being read from or
written to by the hardware has always been an IO concurrency bug in
the application.

The behaviour being talked about here is, and always has been, an
application IO concurrency bug, regardless of PI, stable writes,
etc. Such an application bug existing is *not a valid reason for the
kernel or filesystem to disable Direct IO*.

-Dave.
