Hi Neil and Jens,

 From the commit message, bio_uninit is put here for bio allocated in 
special ways (e.g., on stack), that will not be release by bio_free. For 
chained bio, __bio_chain_endio invokes bio_put and release the 
resources, so it seems that we don't need to call bio_uninit for chained 
bio.

The blk_throtl_bio_endio is used to update the latency for the throttle 
group. I think the latency should only be updated after the whole bio is 
finished?

To make sense for the "tail call optimization" in the comment, I'll 
suggest to wrap the whole statement with an else. What do you think?

if (bio->bi_end_io == bio_chain_endio) {
	bio = __bio_chain_endio(bio);
	goto again;
} else {
	blk_throtl_bio_endio(bio);
	/* release cgroup info */
	bio_uninit(bio);
	if (bio->bi_end_io)
		bio->bi_end_io(bio);
}

Thanks,
Edward Hsieh
