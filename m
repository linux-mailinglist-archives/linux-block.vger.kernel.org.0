Thanks for the history on the raw device. It=E2=80=99s good to the perspecti=
ve on history repeating itself.=20

I believe that the raw block device is different than the raw character devi=
ce and we see tons of applications that don=E2=80=99t want FS semantics rely=
ing on them. But I get your point.

If we agree to get ZoneFS up to speed and use it as the general API for zone=
 devices, then I think we can refocus there.=20

As I mentioned in the last reply to to Dave, the main concern for me at the m=
oment is supporting arbitrary zone sizes in the kernel. If we can agree on a=
 path towards that, we can definitely commit to focus on ZoneFS and implemen=
t support for it on the different places we maintain in user-space.=20=
