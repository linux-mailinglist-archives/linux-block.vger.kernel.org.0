Sorry, I missed that ->last_ran_at is only set when the work isn't
pending, then we can cleanup/simplify the reclaim a bit by:

1) keep lo->idle_work to be scheduled in 60 period if there is any
active worker allocated, which is scheduled when allocating/reclaiming
one worker

2) always set ->last_ran_at after retrieving the worker from xarray,
which can be done lockless via WRITE_ONCE(), and it is cheap

3) inside __loop_free_idle_workers(), reclaim one worker only if the
worker is expired and hasn't commands in worker->cmd_list

I think READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() should be enough, and we can set/get
last_ran_at lockless.

Thanks for the review!
