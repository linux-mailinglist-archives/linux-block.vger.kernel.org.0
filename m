Yes, I definitely need to learn more about it :-). But even with the 
change,
I still believe read a node is cheaper than a script.

And seems biolatency can't trace bio based driver per below, and with
collect data in tree we can trace all block drivers.

# load BPF program
b = BPF(text=bpf_text)
if args.queued:
     b.attach_kprobe(event="blk_account_io_start", 
fn_name="trace_req_start")
else:
     b.attach_kprobe(event="blk_start_request", fn_name="trace_req_start")
     b.attach_kprobe(event="blk_mq_start_request", 
fn_name="trace_req_start")
b.attach_kprobe(event="blk_account_io_completion",
     fn_name="trace_req_completion")

Could it possible to extend it support trace both request and bio? Otherwise
we have to run another script to trace md raid.

Thanks,
Guoqing
