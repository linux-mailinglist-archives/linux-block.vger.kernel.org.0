Hi Ming,

I'm raising the hostwide tags issue again, which I brought up in 
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-block/msg43754.html

Here's that discussion:

Right, not so neat. And we see a 3M vs 2.4M IOPS drop with this 
patchset. That's without any optimisation like discussed in 
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/10/124

And I don't know about any impact of performance of hosts which already 
exposed multiple queues.

Note that it's still much better than the 700K IOPS we see without 
managed interrupts at all.

Yeah, but then we raise the question of why the LLDD can't just register 
for hotplug handler itself.

Personally I prefer #1. I'll have a look at the issues when I get a chance.

Much appreciated,
John
