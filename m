Not sure what you mean with all this. prctl() works per process/thread
and a context that has PR_SET_IO_FLUSHER set will have PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO
set. So for the case of a user block device driver, setting this means
that it cannot reenter itself during a memory allocation, regardless of
the system call it executes (FS etc): all memory allocations in any
syscall executed by the context will have GFP_NOIO.

If the kernel-side driver for the user block device driver does any
allocation that does not have GFP_NOIO, or cause any such allocation
(e.g. within a workqueue it is waiting for), then that is a kernel bug.
Block device drivers are not supposed to ever do a memory allocation in
the IO hot path without GFP_NOIO.
