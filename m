If the tag space is very limited, just create one pthread.

NVMe PCI has per-sq tags so subranges aren't needed. Each pthread has
its own independent tag space. That means NVMe devices with low queue
depths work fine in the model I described.

I don't know the exact SCSI/SATA scenario you mentioned, but if there
are only 32 tags globally then just create one pthread. If you mean AHCI
PCI devices, my understanding is that AHCI is multi-LUN but each port
(LUN) has a single Command List (queue) has an independent tag space.
Therefore each port has just one ublk_queue that is handled by one
pthread.

Tag subranges are pthread, not per-LUN/NS, so these concerns do not
apply to the model I described.

Are there any other reasons why you say this model is not doable?
