Hi Josef,

Just a friendly ping, I am more than happy to test a patch, if you send it
inline in the email, since the pastebin you used expired after 1 day, and I
couldn't access it.

I came across and tested Yu Kuai's patches [1][2] which are for the same issue,
and they indeed fix the hang. Thank you Yu.

[1] nbd: don't clear 'NBD_CMD_INFLIGHT' flag if request is not completed
https://lists.debian.org/nbd/2022/04/msg00212.html

[2] nbd: fix io hung while disconnecting device
https://lists.debian.org/nbd/2022/04/msg00207.html

I am also happy to test any patches to fix the I/O errors.

Thanks,
Matthew
