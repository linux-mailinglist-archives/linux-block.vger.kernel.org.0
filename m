I prefer to the 1st approach:

1) the wait event is still one positive signal for user to cleanup the
device use, since the correct step is to umount ublk disk before deleting
the device.

2) the wait still can avoid the current context to reuse the device
number

3) after switching to wait_event_interruptible(), we need to avoid
double delete, and one flag of UB_STATE_DELETED can be used for failing
new delete command.

4) IMO new flag(UBLK_F_*) isn't needed to distinguish this change
with current behavior.

Please let us know if you'd like to cook one patch for improving
the delete handling.

BTW, there could be another option, such as, 'ublk delete --no-wait' just
run the remove and without waiting at all, but not sure if it is useful.


thanks,
Ming
