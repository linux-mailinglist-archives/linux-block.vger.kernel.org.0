The lie is in generating the device-mapper line for setting up the 
target device.
Format is

0 <size> zoned <zoned-dev> <cache-dev>

and <size> is the capacity of the resulting device-mapper device.
So we should have adapted this to exclude the metadata size and the 
reserved seq zone size (even with the original implementation); 
'blksize' is certainly wrong here.

Yeah, of course. Plan is to start with V2 metadata handling first anyway 
(it adding UUIDs), then add the 'start' functionality, and only then 
implement cache device handling.

Thanks for the patch.
