Yes, it does and it's working.
But because I found that with write caching enabled, it seemd to take all
the writes from the raid rebuild in a big queue, and starving I/O for others
requests that I wanted to happen "right now" (like /bin/ls actually being
loaded and running), and reading how the perc 5/i is a crap card, I turned
off its IO caching, leaving the work to linux' block buffer and the 32GB of
RAM in the server that are mostly allocated to disk IO caching.

Yes, you may be correct on that. I can re-enable it, but it was terrible
with it on, too.

That sounds plausible indeed.

Assuming I can do this without losing the entire filesystem, I can try, but
if it can't do single drive raid0, I doubt changing this to single drive
raid1 would make things much better.
Then again, once you're hitting things that aren't working as they should...

I have an H700 in the mail that should arrive tonight, I'll try swapping
that first and see what happens.

Thanks for the answer,
