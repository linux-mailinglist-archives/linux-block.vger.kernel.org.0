Subject: [PATCH 0/5] blk-mq: support nested queue quiescing

Hello,

request queue quiescing has been applied in lots of block drivers and
block core from different/un-related code paths. So far, both quiesce
and unquiesce changes the queue state unconditionally. This way has
caused trouble, such as, driver is quiescing queue for its own purpose,
however block core's queue quiesce may come because of elevator switch,
updating nr_requests or other queue attributes, then un-expected
unquiesce may come too early.

It has been observed kernel panic when running stress test on dm-mpath
suspend and updating nr_requests.

Fix the issue by supporting nested queue quiescing. But nvme has very
complicated uses on quiesce/unquiesce, which two may not be called in
pairing, so switch to this way in patch 1~4, and patch 5 provides
nested queue quiesce.


Ming Lei (5):
  nvme: add APIs for stopping/starting admin queue
  nvme: apply nvme API to quiesce/unquiesce admin queue
  nvme: prepare for pairing quiescing and unquiescing
  nvme: paring quiesce/unquiesce
  blk-mq: support nested blk_mq_quiesce_queue()
