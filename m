Sorry to reply so quickly after my prior reply, but I might have found
an extreme corner case where we can still run into the same race even
if has_work() is exact.  This is all theoretical from code analysis.
Maybe you can poke a hole in my scenario or tell me it's so
implausible that we don't care, but it seems like it's theoretically
possible.  For this example I'll assume a budget of 1 (AKA only one
thread can get budget for a given queue):

* Threads A and B both run has_work() at the same time with the same
  "hctx".  has_work() is exact but there's no lock, so it's OK if
  Thread A and B both get back true.

* Thread B gets interrupted for a long time right after it decides
  that there is work.  Maybe its CPU gets an interrupt and the
  interrupt handler is slow.

* Thread A runs, get budget, dispatches work.

* Thread A's work finishes and budget is released.

* Thread B finally runs again and gets budget.

* Since Thread A already took care of the work and no new work has
  come in, Thread B will get NULL from dispatch_request().  I believe
  this is specifically why dispatch_request() is allowed to return
  NULL in the first place if has_work() must be exact.

* Thread B will now be holding the budget and is about to call
  put_budget(), but hasn't called it yet.

* Thread B gets interrupted for a long time (again).  Dang interrupts.

* Now Thread C (with a different "hctx" but the same queue) comes
  along and runs blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched().

* Thread C won't do anything because it can't get budget.

* Finally Thread B will run again and put the budget without kicking
  any queues.

Now we have a potential I/O stall because nobody will ever kick the
queues.


I think the above example could happen even on non-BFQ systems and I
think it would also be fixed by an approach like the one in my patch.
