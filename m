Patch [2/2] indeed dealt with a zram instance race but the issue was not
a crash due to indirection, it was because of a deadlock. The deadlock
happens because a shared mutex is used both at sysfs and also on __exit.
I'll expand on the example as you request so that both issues are
clearly understood.

The zram race you spotted which could lead to a derefence and crash is
a separate one, which the bget() / bdput() on sysfs knobs resolves. That
race happens because zram's sysfs knobs don't prevent del_gendisk() from
completing currently, and so a dereference can happen.

Sure. Will post a v2.

I suspect these issue are generic, however hard to reproduce, but this
just means busying out sysfs knobs and doing module removal can likely
cause crashes to some kernel drivers.

Since it seems the position to take is module removal is best effort,
if crashes on module removal are important to module maintainers, the
position to take is that such races are best addressed on the driver
side, not core.

Same situation here, as the race is with module removal.

Even in the case where module removal is possible today and likely
"supported" -- on livepatching, it seems we're shying away slowly from
that situation, and will likely expose a knob to ensure removing a
livepatch (and do module removal) will require a knob to be flipped
to say, "Yes, I know what I am doing").

OK great.

Sure, I'll address all sysfs knobs in v2.
