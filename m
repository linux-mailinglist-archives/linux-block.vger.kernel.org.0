__submit_bio_noacct_mq() returns cookie from the last bio in current->bio_list, and
this bio should be the bio passed to __submit_bio_noacct_mq() when bio splitting happens.

Suppose CPU migration happens during bio splitting, the last bio should be
submitted to LLD much late than other bios, so when blk_poll() finds
completion on the hw queue of the last bio, usually other bios should
be completed already most of times.

Also CPU migration itself causes much bigger latency, so it is reasonable to
not expect good IO performance when CPU migration is involved. And CPU migration
on IO task shouldn't have been done frequently. That said it should be
fine to miss the poll in this situation.

Also the following part of your patch may not work reliably:

@@ -370,7 +370,8 @@ static struct request *__blk_mq_alloc_request(struct blk_mq_alloc_data *data)
        }

 retry:
-       data->ctx = blk_mq_get_ctx(q);
+       cpu = (data->cpu_hint != -1) ? data->cpu_hint : raw_smp_processor_id();
+       data->ctx = __blk_mq_get_ctx(q, cpu);
        data->hctx = blk_mq_map_queue(q, data->cmd_flags, data->ctx);
        if (!e)
                blk_mq_tag_busy(data->hctx);

If the cpu of data->cpu_hint is becoming offline, the above retry may
never be finished. Also I really don't like this way to allocate request
on specified cpu or ctx.

At least dm(except for dm-mpath) doesn't use blk-mq , so far io poll is
based on blk-mq. Not mention it could be hard to return the expected
cookie.

It is for preventing stack overflows.

Please take a close look at bio_alloc_bioset's comment and understand
why 'callers must never allocate more than 1 bio at a time from this pool'
