Thanks for sharing.  This is a very interesting implementation that
seems to cover quite well the original use case.  I'm giving it a try and
will report back.

I've run into the same issue with my fd implementation and haven't been
able to workaround it.

I was thinking of something like this, or having a way for the server to
only operate on the fds and do splice/sendfile.  But, I don't know if it
would be useful for many use cases.  We also want to be able to send the
data to userspace, for instance, for userspace networking.
