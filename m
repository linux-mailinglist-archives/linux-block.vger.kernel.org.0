Requeueing and retry has always been available on the block side. It's
not an uncommon thing for a driver to need, in case of resource
starvation. And sometimes those resources can be unrelated to the IO, eg
iommu shortages. Or this busy condition.

But that's fine, it's not uncommon for drivers to miss things like that,
and then we fix them up when noticed. It was probably written by someone
not super familiar with the IO stack.

Because your change never gives up, hence it'd never trigger the softer
retry condition. It'll just keep busy looping.

While I agree that the bug is unfortunate, it's also a chance to
properly fix it rather than just go back to busy looping. How difficult
is it to test an iteration of the patch? It'd be annoying to queue a
bandaid only to have to revert that again for a real fix. If this was a
regression from the last release or two then that'd be a different
story, but the fact that this has persisted for 6.5 years and is only
bubbling back up to mainstream now would seem to indicate that we should
spend a bit of extra time to just get it right the first time.
