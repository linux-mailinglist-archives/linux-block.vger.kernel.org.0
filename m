If the order isn't guaranteed, either of the following two documents has to be wrong:

Documentation/memory-barriers.txt:
	...
	In all cases there are variants on "ACQUIRE" operations and "RELEASE" operations
	for each construct.  These operations all imply certain barriers:
	
	 (1) ACQUIRE operation implication:
	
	     Memory operations issued after the ACQUIRE will be completed after the
	     ACQUIRE operation has completed.

Documentation/atomic_bitops.txt:
	...
	Except for a successful test_and_set_bit_lock() which has ACQUIRE semantics and
	clear_bit_unlock() which has RELEASE semantics.

Setting the tag bit is part of successful test_and_set_bit_lock(), which has ACQUIRE
semantics, and any Memory operations(test_bit(INACTIVE)) after the ACQUIRE will be
completed after the ACQUIRE has completed according to the above two documents.

Thanks,
Ming
