Hey Christoph,
Thanks for the suggestion. I finally sent out v2 for this patch at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20210325212609.492188-1-satyat@google.com/

I tried doing something similar to what you suggested to avoid
creating an -EIO path, but instead of changing the size limits exposed
by the driver, I changed the allowed data unit sizes based on the
exposed size limits. I did it that way because the limits that
interfere with inline encryption happen to be "hard limits" a driver
can't lie about, like having support for SG gaps or not requiring
chunk sectors. Another reason for doing it this way is so that we
don't interfere with regular unencrypted I/O by changing driver
exposed limits unconditionally (and I didn't think it was
straightforward to expose two different sets of limits of encrypted
and unencrypted I/O respectively). Please take a look at the new patch
series if you're able to. Thanks!
