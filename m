Yes.

But that is the issue: if we defer the report zones, we cannot make progress
with BIOs still plugged in the zone write plug BIO list. These hold a queue
usage reference that the queue freeze wait is waiting for. We have to somehow
allow that report zones to execute to make progress and empty the zone write
plugs of all plugged BIOs.

Note that if we were talking about regular writes only, we would not need to
care about error recovery as we would simply need to abort all these plugged
BIOs (as we know they will fail anyway). But for a correct zone append
emulation, we need to recover the zone write pointer to resume the execution of
the plugged BIOs. Otherwise, the user would see failed zone append commands that
are not suppose to fail unless the drive (or the zone) is dead...

That would not change a thing. The issue is that if a queue freeze has started,
executing a report zone can block on a request allocation (on the
blk_queue_enter() it implies if there are no cached requests). So the same
problem remains.

Though I agree that the error recovery could be moved to the zone BIO work and
we could get rid of the error recovery work.

But we still need to somehow allow that report zone to execute even if a queue
freeze has started... Hence the idea of the BLK_MQ_REQ_INTERNAL flag to allow
that, for special cases like this one were completing BIOs depends on first
executing another internal command. Or maybe we could try to pre-allocate a
request for such case, but managing that request to not have it freed to be able
to reuse it until all errors are processed may need many block layer changes...
