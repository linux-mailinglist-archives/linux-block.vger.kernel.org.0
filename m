Some time ago, I started to describe the setup a little bit in [1]. Now
I want to extend the description:

The boot infrastructure is used in the university environment and
quarrels with network-related limitations. Step-by-step, the network
hardware is renewed and improved, but there are still many university
branches which are spread all over the city and connected by poor uplink
connections. Sometimes there exist cases where 15 until 20 desktop
computers have to share only 1 gigabit uplink. To accelerate the network
boot, the idea came up to use the QCOW2 file format and its compression
feature for the image content. Tests have shown, that the usage of
compression is already measurable at gigabit uplinks and clearly
noticeable at 100 megabit uplinks.

The network boot infrastructure is based on a classical PXE network boot
to load the Linux kernel and the initramfs. In the initramfs, the
compressed QCOW2 image is fetched via nfs or cifs or something else. The
fetched QCOW2 image is now decompressed and read in the kernel. Compared
to a decompression and read in the user space, like qemu-nbd does, this
approach does not need any user space process, is faster and avoids
switchroot problems.

The in-kernel QCOW2 implementation uses the fetched QCOW2 image and
exposes it as block device.

Therefore, my implementation extends the loop device module by a general
file format subsystem to implement various file format drivers including
a driver for the QCOW2 and RAW file format. The configuration utility
losetup is used to set up a loop device and specify the file format
driver to use.

To achieve a running system one have to complete the following items:

  * Set up a PXE boot server and configure client computers to boot from
    the network
  * Build a Linux kernel for the network boot with built-in QCOW2
    implementation
  * Prepare the initramfs for the network boot. Use a network file
    system or copy tool to fetch the compressed QCOW2 image.
  * Create a compressed QCOW2 image that contains a complete environment
    for the user to work with after a successful network boot
  * Set up the reading of the fetched QCOW2 image using the in-kernel
    QCOW2 implementation and mount the file systems located in the QCOW2
    image.
  * Perform a switchroot to change into the mounted environment of the
    QCOW2 image.


Thanks for your help.

Regards,
Manuel
