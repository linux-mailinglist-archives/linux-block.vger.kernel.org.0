Good point.  Many systems have their limit for the maximum number of the
devices.  Thus, 'arbitrarily' large number of devices cannot be attached.  So,
there is the upperbound.  System administrators might be able to avoid the
memory pressure problem by setting the limit low enough or giving more memory
to the 'blkback' running guest.

However, many systems also tempt to set the limit high enough so that guests
can satisfy and to give minimal memory to the 'blkback' running guest for cost
efficiency.

I believe this patchset can be helpful for such situations.

Anyway, using the term 'arbitrarily' is obvisously my fault.  I will update the
description in the next version of patchset.


Thanks,
