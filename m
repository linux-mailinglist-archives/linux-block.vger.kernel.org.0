Oh, what I intend to say is it's impossible adding "BLKREPORTZONE" to regular block device driver.
We have to construct fake zone information for regular device all by dmzadm, based on current information
we can get from regular device.

$ dmzadm --format `regular device` `real zoned device` --force

Thank you for all these suggestions.
