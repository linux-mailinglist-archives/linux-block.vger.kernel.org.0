Another blocking point is rq_qos_throttle(), so I guess falling back to
REQ_NOWAIT may not fix the issue completely.

Given iopoll isn't supposed to in case of big IO, another solution
may be to disable iopoll when bio splitting is needed, something
like the following change:

diff --git a/block/blk-merge.c b/block/blk-merge.c
index bcf5e4580603..8e762215660b 100644
--- a/block/blk-merge.c
+++ b/block/blk-merge.c
@@ -279,6 +279,12 @@ static struct bio *blk_bio_segment_split(struct request_queue *q,
 	return NULL;
 split:
 	*segs = nsegs;
+
+	/*
+	 * bio splitting may cause more trouble for iopoll which isn't supposed
+	 * to be used in case of big IO
+	 */
+	bio->bi_opf &= ~REQ_HIPRI;
 	return bio_split(bio, sectors, GFP_NOIO, bs);
 }
 


Thanks, 
Ming
