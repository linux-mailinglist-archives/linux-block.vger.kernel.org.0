Awesome! Thanks. Updates to Documentation/scsi/BusLogic.rst to match
these changes would be great. Doc currently lists "IO:" and "NoProbeISA"
which can go away. "Supported Host Adapters: section lists ISA and EISA
adapters that can go away as well. There is reference to ISA in
"QueueDepth:<integer>" - "For Host Adapters that require ISA Bounce
Buffers, the Queue Depth is automatically set by default to
BusLogic_TaggedQueueDepthBB or BusLogic_UntaggedQueueDepthBB to avoid
excessive preallocation of DMA Bounce Buffer memory." which is
irrelevant now.

Thanks,
Khalid
