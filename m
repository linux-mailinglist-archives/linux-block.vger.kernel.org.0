I could not find issue in " scsi: core: only re-run queue in
scsi_end_request" even though above mentioned patch is reverted.
There may be some corner cases/race condition in submission path which can
be fixed doing self-restart of h/w queue.

I was thinking your original approach is simple, but if you think some
other simple approach I can test as part of these series.
BTW, I am still not getting why you think your original approach is not
good design.

OK. But I thought all the hctx will see issue independently, if they are
active and they will restart its own hctx queue.
BTW, do you think above handling in block layer code make sense
irrespective of current h/w queue restart logic OR it is just relative
stuffs ?

I understood.  But that performance issue is due to budget contention and
may impact some old HBA(less queue depth) or emulation HBA.
That is why I thought your patch of conditional h/w run from completion
would improve performance.

I was not aware of this. Thanks for info.  I will review the code for my
own understanding.
