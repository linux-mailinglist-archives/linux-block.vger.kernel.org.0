> 1) Updated the comments in patches 4 and 6 for greater specificity.
> 2) In patch 6, replaced the @queued parameter with @sq in both

> [BUG]
> The current blkthrotl code provides two types of throttling: BPS limit and
> IOPS limit. When both limits are enabled, an IO is only dispatched if it
> meets both the BPS and IOPS restrictions. However, when both BPS and IOPS
> are limited simultaneously, an IO delayed dispatch issue can occur due to
> IO splitting. For example, if two 1MB IOs are issued with a BPS limit of
> 1MB/s and a very high IOPS limit, the IO splitting will cause both IOs to
> complete almost "simultaneously" in 2 seconds.
> 
> [CAUSE]
> The root cause of this issue is that blkthrotl mixes BPS and IOPS into a
> single queue. When issuing multiple IOs sequentially, the continuously
> split IOs will repeatedly enter the same queue. As they alternately go
> through the throtl process, IOs that have already been throttled will have
> to wait for IOs that have not yet been throttled. As a result, all IOs will
> eventually complete almost together.
> 
> [FIX]
> Since IO requests that have already been split no longer need to go through
> BPS throttling but still require IOPS control, this patchset splits the
> existing blkthrotl queue into two separate queues: BPS and IOPS.
> 1) IO requests must first pass through the BPS queue.
> 2) Once they meet the BPS limit, they proceed to the IOPS queue before
> being dispatched.
> 3) Already split IO requests bypass the BPS queue and go directly to the
> IOPS queue.
> 
> [OVERVIEW]
> This patchset consists of 7 patches:
> 1) Patch 1 is a simple clean_up.
> 2) Patch 2-4, to facilitate the subsequent splitting of queues. Patch 2-3
> separate the -dispatch- and -charge- functions based on the BPS and IOPS.
> Patch 4 introduce a new flag to prevent double counting.
> 3) Patch 5-6 splits the original single queue into two separate queues(BPS
> and IOPS) without altering the existing code logic.
> 4) Patch 7 ensures that split IO requests bypass the BPS queue, preventing
> unnecessary throttling and eliminating the delay issue.
