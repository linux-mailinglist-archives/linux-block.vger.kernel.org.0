I agree. The API should be clean and common, but that should not prevent
extensions to ZAC/ZBC or ZNS specifics. The suggestions you propose in
the other patches make sense to do this properly.

Yes.

I think this is a very nice goal, but I do believe we will not be able
to keep a 100% consistent behavior. We will have new features on either
of the specs that do not make sense on the other and we will have to
deal with them. We can deal with this as generic optional features, but
at the end of the day, applications will need to check whether the
feature is selected or not.

This said, I agree that we need a good way to communicate this, and the
suggestions you made with sysfs parameters and flags make sense to me.

Makes sense. See the reply on the patch itself.
