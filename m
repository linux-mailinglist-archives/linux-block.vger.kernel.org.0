Hi Josef, Kuai,

Josef, thank you for attaching your patch. No worries about being on vacati=
on,
I hope you enjoyed your time off.

Josef, I built your patch ontop of 5.18-rc6 with no other patches applied, =
and
ran the testcase in my original message. After 3x loops, a hang occurred, a=
nd
we see the usual -32 error:

May 16 03:38:35 focal-nbd kernel: block nbd15: NBD_DISCONNECT
May 16 03:38:35 focal-nbd kernel: block nbd15: Send disconnect failed -32

The hang lasted 30 seconds, no doubt caused by the "30 * HZ" timeout in you=
r
patch, and things started moving forward again:

May 16 03:39:05 focal-nbd kernel: block nbd15: Connection timed out,
retrying (0/1 alive)
May 16 03:39:05 focal-nbd kernel: block nbd15: Connection timed out,
retrying (0/1 alive)
May 16 03:39:05 focal-nbd kernel: blk_print_req_error: 128 callbacks suppre=
ssed
May 16 03:39:05 focal-nbd kernel: I/O error, dev nbd15, sector 1023488
op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 14 prio class 0
May 16 03:39:05 focal-nbd kernel: I/O error, dev nbd15, sector 1023608
op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 16 prio class 0
May 16 03:39:05 focal-nbd kernel: block nbd15: Device being setup by
another task

Note the timestamp increment of 30s. There were a whole host of I/O errors,
and after a few more loops, the hang occurred again, again lasting for 30
seconds, and then doing a few more loops before getting stuck again.

Pastebin of journalctl: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Cx6MBC8Vgj/

Unfortunately, your patch doesn't quite solve the issue.

Kuai, I tested your suspicions by building Josef's patch ontop of 5.18-rc6 =
with
your below patch applied:

nbd: don't clear 'NBD_CMD_INFLIGHT' flag if request is not completed
https://lists.debian.org/nbd/2022/04/msg00212.html.

The behaviour was different this time from Josef's patch alone. On the very
second iteration of the loop, I got a bunch of I/O errors, and the nbd subs=
ystem
hung, and did not recover. I started getting stuck request messages, and
the usual hung task timeout oops messages.

Pastebin of journalctl here: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/C9rjckrWtp/

I went back and did some more testing of Kuai's two commits:

nbd: don't clear 'NBD_CMD_INFLIGHT' flag if request is not completed
https://lists.debian.org/nbd/2022/04/msg00212.html

nbd: fix io hung while disconnecting device
https://lists.debian.org/nbd/2022/04/msg00207.html

I left the testcase running for about 20 minutes, and it never hung. It did
get a bit racey from time to time trying to get a write lock for the qcow i=
mage,
where the disconnect completed after the call to mkfs.ext4 started, but sim=
ply
saying "y" let the loop run for another 5 minutes before the race occurred
again.

Formatting 'foo.img', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D524288000 cluster_size=3D65536

/dev/nbd15 contains a ext4 file system labelled 'root'
    created on Mon May 16 05:23:01 2022
Proceed anyway? (y,N)

Through my whole time testing Kuai's fixes, I never saw a hang. The behavio=
ur
seen is the same as the workaround of preventing systemd from watching nbd
devices with inotify. I think we should go with Kuai's patches.

So for Kuai's two patches:

Tested-by: Matthew Ruffell <matthew.ruffell@canonical.com>

Thanks,
Matthew
