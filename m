Yes, if we write a new udev rule or script we could place bread crumbs
in the journal so we can correlate
sda == naa.5000cca02b38d0b8 at the time of the error.  However, none of
the existing tooling will allow you to see all the log messages that
pertain to the device easily.  The user is still left with a bunch of
log messages that have different ways to refer to the same device
attachment eg. sda, ata1.00, sd 0:0:0:0.  For them to understand which
messages go with which device is not trivial.  Even if someone writes a
tool to parse the messages, looking for the string that contains the ID
and has the needed decoder information to associate it with the correct
piece of hardware, it's only good until the message changes in the kernel.

If we stuff the defacto ID into the message itself when it occurs, the
ambiguity of what device is associated with a message is removed.

I would like to know, why this is so horrible?  Is it processing time in
an error path?  Stack usage holding the data in flight, wasted disk
space on disk?  Unique identifiers are just too long and terse?

The only valid reason I can think of is someone working with very
sensitive data and not wanting the unique ID of a removable or network
storage device to be in their logs.  Of course we could add a disable
boot time option for that or make the default off for those that don't
want/care.

Assuming the error reproduces, this would work.  However, I think this
solution speaks volumes for how difficult it is to simply identify what
device an error originated from.
