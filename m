page_to_phys() supposes to return page's physical address, which
should just depend on this machine's physical address space,
not related with page mapping.

I understand physical address 0 might be valid, such as the 1st
page frame of ram.

IMO, zero physical address case is the only corner case not
covered by using 'phys_addr_t'. If phys_addr_t is 32bit, sum of
page_to_phys(start_page) and offset shouldn't be >= 4G.
