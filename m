The keychains are all NULL and won't be allocated (by init) without
copying a new cred, right?  And it seems like smack, selinux, and
apparmor at least each set the security field to a copy of the
daemon's.  Now, in theory, some LSM *could* come by and try to merge
current's info with init's, but that would probably be misguided.

So this does seem like it should work.
