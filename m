Before we'd end up in Lo_unbound toward the end of __loop_clr_fd
if there was a single opener.

That would be my preference.  Any code that is doing a clear_fd
and then tries to configure it again is prone to races vs other
openers.  It also does not seem very useful outside of test code.
But if we end up breaking real code and not test cases we might have
to go and bring it back.
