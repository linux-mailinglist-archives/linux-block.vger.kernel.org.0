Hi Ulf,

Verified internally regarding the busy state over DATA0 Our host design=20
has known minor bug where command complete interrupt is asserted after=20
waiting for busy cycles from device.So because of this polling for=20
card_busy() returns 0 (DAT0 line High) immediately as waiting for busy=20
is taken care during command complete interrupt in host design. This=20
behavior is same for R1 and R1B.
