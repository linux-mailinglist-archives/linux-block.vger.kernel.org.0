Well; the more important bits would be to identify the physical location 
where these disks reside.
If one goes bad it doesn't really help you if have a persistent 
identification in the OS; what you really need is a physical indicator 
or a physical location allowing you to identify which disk to pull.

Which isn't addressed at all with this patchset (nor should it; the 
physical location it typically found via other means).

And for the other use-cases: We do have persistent device links, do we 
not? They provide even more information that you'd extract with this 
this patchset, and don't require any kernel changes whatsoever.

Cheers,

Hannes
