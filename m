So am I, but I'm even more scared of having no other way of verifying this
than doing it "by hand". It's nothing critical here - just some variables
that will remain long instead of being int, but I'd like to have some way to
verify the change. A coccinelle script would be great, even if it misses
some places, I can at least have some trust in it.

If I have to verify the whole tree by hand, even with grep/ag, I don't trust
I'll do it right.


I gave Coccinelle a try, I think I got something for in-function variables:

---
@state_var@
struct task_struct *p;
identifier prev_state;
@@
prev_state = p->state

@@
identifier state_var.prev_state;
@@
- long prev_state;
+ int prev_state;
---

I tried something for function parameters, which seems to be feasible
according to [1], but couldn't get it to work (yet). Here's what I have
so far:

---
@func_param@
identifier func;
identifier p;
identifier state;
identifier mask;
@@

func(struct task_struct *p, const struct cpumask *mask, long state)
{
...
}

@@
identifier func_param.func;
identifier func_param.state;
expression E1;
expression E2;
@@

func(E1,
- long state,
+ int state,
E2)
---

(it should match against kernel/kthread.c::__kthread_bind_mask() but it
complains about me not knowing how to write coccinelle patches).

With a mix of these we might get somewhere...
