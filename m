That requires access to at least the block device and without PO2
emulation that is not possible. Using zonefs is not possible today
for !PO2 devices.

This effort is not upstream yet, however, once and if this does land
upstream it does mean something other than zonefs must be used since
!PO2 devices are not supported by zonefs. So although the goal with the
zonefs was to provide a unified interface for raw access for
applications, the PO2 requirement will essentially create
fragmenetation.

Using Linux requires PO2. And so on behalf of Damien's request the
logical thing to do was to upkeep that requirement and to avoid any
performance regressions. That "crap" was done to slowly pave the way
forward to then later remove the PO2 requirement.

I think we'll all acknowledge that doing emulation just means adding more
software for something that is not a NAND requirement, but a requirement
imposed by the inheritance of zoned software designed for SMR HDDs. I
think we may also all acknowledge now that keeping this emulation code
*forever* seems like complete insanity.

Since the PO2 requirement imposed on Linux today seems to be now
sending us down a dubious effort we'd need to support, let me
then try to get folks who have been saying that we must keep this
requirement to answer the following question:

Are you 100% sure your ZNS hardware team and firmware team will always
be happy you have caked in a PO2 requirement for ZNS drives on Linux
and are you ready to deal with those consequences on Linux forever? Really?

NAND has no PO2 requirement. The emulation effort was only done to help
add support for !PO2 devices because there is no alternative. If we
however are ready instead to go down the avenue of removing those
restrictions well let's go there then instead. If that's not even
something we are willing to consider I'd really like folks who stand
behind the PO2 requirement to stick their necks out and clearly say that
their hw/fw teams are happy to deal with this requirement forever on ZNS.

From what I am seeing this is a legacy requirement which we should be
able to remove. Keeping the requirement will only do harm to ZNS
adoption on Linux and it will also create *more* fragmentation.
