I see. So, we can go for adding split handling to all other places or try to
find a common spot.

But yeah, this should work too. This is simpler but more fragile given the
twisted history around BIO_THROTTLED. I think the root cause of the
convolution is that it's hooked at the wrong spot - it's sitting on top of
the queue trying to guess what actually happens to the bios it sent down.
Ideally, we probably wanna move this to rq-qos hooks which sit on the actual
issue-to-the-device path.

For now, I don't have a strong preference. This looks fine to me too. Please
feel free to add

for the blk-throtl patches.

Thanks.
