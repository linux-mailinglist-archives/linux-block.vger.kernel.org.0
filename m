These versions are for userspace's benefit (be it lvm2, cryptsetup,
multipath-tools, etc).  But yes, these versions are bogus even for
that -- primarily because it requires userspace to know when a
particular feature/fix it cares about was introduced.  In addition: if
fixes, that also bump version, are marked for stable@ then we're quickly
in versioning hell -- which is why I always try to decouple version
bumps from fixes.

Others have suggested setting feature flags.  I expect you'd hate those
too.  I suspect I quickly would too given flag bits are finite and
really tedious to deal with.

I'll think further about this issue and consult with userspace
developers and see what we might do.

Thanks (for the needed kick in the ass).
Mike
