Subject: [PATCH BUGFIX IMPROVEMENT V2 1/1] block, bfq: check also in-flight I/O in dispatch plugging
Date:   Mon, 15 Jul 2019 12:57:19 +0200

Consider a sync bfq_queue Q that remains empty while in service, and
suppose that, when this happens, there is a fair amount of already
in-flight I/O not belonging to Q. This situation is not considered
when deciding whether to plug I/O dispatching (until new I/O arrives
for Q). But it has to be checked, for the following reason.

The drive may decide to serve in-flight non-Q's I/O requests before
Q's ones, thereby delaying the arrival of new I/O requests for Q
(recall that Q is sync). If I/O-dispatching is not plugged, then,
while Q remains empty, a basically uncontrolled amount of I/O from
other queues may be dispatched too, possibly causing the service of
Q's I/O to be delayed even longer in the drive. This problem gets more
and more serious as the speed and the queue depth of the drive grow,
because, as these two quantities grow, the probability to find no
queue busy but many requests in flight grows too.

This commit performs I/O-dispatch plugging in this scenario.  Plugging
minimizes the delay induced by already in-flight I/O, and enables Q to
recover the bandwidth it may lose because of this delay.

As a practical example, under write load on a Samsung SSD 970 PRO,
gnome-terminal starts in 1.5 seconds after this fix, against 15
seconds before the fix (as a reference, gnome-terminal takes about 35
seconds to start with any of the other I/O schedulers).
