If you want to keep dividing into Rust-land and C-land I'm afraid you
will have 2 islands that do not talk to each other. I really want to be
able to parse the things quickly and not constantly think if my Rust is
idiomatic enough or I could write the code in a more idiomatic way with
something brand new that just got off the nightly list and moved into
stable.

I am sure we could come up with something like:

	if (!contains(MAKE_RANGE_INCL(512, 4096), size))
		...

but even if something possible it does not mean it needs to be done.

This is a private function and an implementation detail. Why does it
need to be exposed in documentation at all?

Thanks.
