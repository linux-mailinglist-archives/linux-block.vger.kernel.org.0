Thanks for confirming.

One question here is that we are preparing a RFC for a io_uring passthru
using the block device. Based on this discussion, it seems to me that
you see this more suitable through the char device.

Does it make sense that we post this RFC using the block device? It
would be helpful to get early feedback before starting the char device.

This is reasonable. I can re-spin this for append to become read-only
and then we work in parallel for the char device interface.

I see that this does not make much sense for the other non-supported
features in this patch (i.e., !po2 zone size and zoc). Since this is
very much like PI today, is it OK we add these the same way (capacity 0)
and then move to the char device when ready?
