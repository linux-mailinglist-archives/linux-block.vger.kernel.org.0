Thread C will re-run queue in this case:

Just thought scsi_mq_get_budget() does handle the case via re-run queue:

        if (atomic_read(&sdev->device_busy) == 0 && !scsi_device_blocked(sdev))
                blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue(hctx, SCSI_QUEUE_DELAY);

So looks no such race.

No, please don't do that un-conditionally we just need to re-run queue
when there has work to do.
