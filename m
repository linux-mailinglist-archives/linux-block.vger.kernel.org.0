Yeah, but it is really bad.

Now QD is the host hard queue depth, which can be very big, and could be
more than thousands.

ublk driver doesn't understand this kind of sharing(tag, io command buffer, io
buffers), M * M * QD requests are submitted to ublk server, and CPUs/memory
are wasted a lot.

Every device has to allocate command buffers for holding QD io commands, and
command buffer is supposed to be per-host, instead of per-disk. Same with io
buffer pre-allocation in userspace side.

Userspace has to re-tag the requests for avoiding duplicated tag, and
requests have to be throttled in ublk server side. If you implement tag allocation
in userspace side, it is still one typical shared data issue in SMP, M pthreads
contends on single tags from multiple CPUs.

I believe I have explained, in reality, NVME SQ/CQ pair can be less(
or much less) than nr_cpu_ids, so the per-queue-tags can be allocated & freed
among CPUs of (nr_cpu_ids / nr_hw_queues).

Not mention userspace is capable of overriding the pthread cpu affinity,
so it isn't trivial & cheap, M pthreads could be run from
more than (nr_cpu_ids / nr_hw_queues) CPUs and contend on the single hw queue tags.

Fine, but I am not sure we need to support such mess & pool implementation.

It is possible, but it is poor in both performance and resource
utilization, meantime with complicated ublk server implementation.

Not only avoiding memory and cpu waste, but also simplifying ublk

Basically (tags, io command buffer, io buffers) need to move into
host/hw_queue wide from disk wide, so not so simple, but won't
be too complicated.

blk-mq has built-in host/hw_queue wide tag allocation, which can provide
unique tag for ublk server from ublk driver side, so everything can be
simplified a lot if we move (tag, io command buffer, io buffers) into
host/hw_queue wide by telling ublk_driver that we are
BLK_MQ_F_TAG_QUEUE_SHARED.

Not sure if io_uring's provided buffer is good here, cause we need to
discard io buffers after queue become idle. But it won't be one big
deal if zero copy can be supported.
