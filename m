Ah, what I really meant with that sentence was "Currently, if a bio is
split, the size of the resulting bio is guaranteed to be aligned to a
the lbs. The endpoint of the bio might also be aligned to a physical
block boundary (which 9cc5169cd478 tries to achieve if possible), but
the bio's size (and hence also its endpoint since the start of the bio
is always lbs aligned) is *at least* lbs aligned". Does that sound
accurate?

With inline encryption, that lbs alignment guarantee is no longer
enough - the bio now needs to have a size that's aligned to the bio's
data unit size (which may be larger than the logical block size, but
is also still a power of 2).

That would've been awesome, but I don't think we can do that :(
1) There isn't only one crypto data unit size. A device can support,
   and upper layers are free to use, many different data unit sizes.
2) IIUC 9cc5169cd478 (or more accurately get_max_io_size() since the
   function has been changed slightly since your original patch)
   doesn't align the size of the bio to the pbs - it only aligns the
   endpoint of the bio to the pbs (and it may actually not even do
   that if it turns out to not be possible). Is that right? If so,
   that means that if the startpoint of the bio isn't pbs aligned, the
   size of the bio won't be pbs aligned either.
