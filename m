Some workloads need this optimization, please see 729204ef49ec00b
("block: relax check on sg gap"):

    If the last bvec of the 1st bio and the 1st bvec of the next
    bio are physically contigious, and the latter can be merged
    to last segment of the 1st bio, we should think they don't
    violate sg gap(or virt boundary) limit.

    Both Vitaly and Dexuan reported lots of unmergeable small bios
    are observed when running mkfs on Hyper-V virtual storage, and
    performance becomes quite low. This patch fixes that performance
    issue.

It can be observed that thousands of 512byte bios in one request when
running mkfs related workloads.

Request based drivers usually shouldn't iterate bio any more.
