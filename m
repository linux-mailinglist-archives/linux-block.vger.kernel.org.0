I checked the disassembly and we still have the load instead of the add.

This is not surprising, as the compiler would not know for certain that 
we point to a field within the same struct. But at least we still should 
point to a close memory.

Note that the pointer could be dropped, which would remove the load, but 
then we have many if-elses which could be slower, not to mention that 
the blk-mq-tag code deals in bitmap pointers anyway.

Thanks,
John
