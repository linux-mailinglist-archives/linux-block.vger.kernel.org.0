Let's move them on top of ifdef CONFIG_ZRAM_WRITEBACK, then.
IOW, above of writeback_limit_enable_store.

Yes, we couldn't get the perfect number everyone would be happpy
since we don't know their configuration but the value is the
typical UFS 3.1(even, it's little old sice UFS has higher queue depth)'s
queue depth. More good thing with the 32 is aligned with SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX
which is the unit of batching in the traditional split LRU reclaim.

Assuming we don't encounter any significant regressions, I'd like to
move forward with a queue depth of 32 so that all users can benefit from
this speedup.

Sorry, I didn't understand what's the post-processing means.

First, this writeback_store path is not critical path. Typical usecase
is trigger the writeback store on system idle time to save zram memory.

Second, If you used the flag to relieve memory pressure, that's not
the right flag. GFP_NOIO aimed to prevent deadlock with IO context
but the writeback_store is just process context so no reason to use
the GFP_NOIO. (If we really want to releieve memory presure, we
should use __GFP_NORETRY with ~__GFP_RECLAIM but I doubt)

I meant I didn't took close look the part, yet. :)
