Agreed that I should have Cc-ed you on the cgroup patches. But where 
were you while my mq-deadline patch series was out for review? The first 
version of that patch series was published on May 27 and the patch 
series was merged on June 21 so there was almost one month time to post 
review feedback.

Additionally, the above description is not very helpful. If it is not 
allowed to add custom elements by adding more pd_stat_fn callbacks, why 
does that callback even exist? Why does the cgroup core not complain if 
a new policy is registered that defines a pd_stat_fn callback?

You write that this isn't the right way to collect per cgroup stats. 
What is the "right way"? Has this been documented somewhere?

Bart.
