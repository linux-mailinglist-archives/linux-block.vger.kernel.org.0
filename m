Hello, this would usually need an NMI sent from a management interface
as with it locked up no guarantee a sysrq c will get there from the
keyboard.=C2=A0
You could try though.

As long as you have in /etc/kdump.conf=20

path /var/crash
core_collector makedumpfile -l --message-level 7 -d 31

This will get kernel only pages and would not be very big.

I could work with you privately to get what we need out of the vmcore
and we would avoid transferring it.

Thanks
Laurence
