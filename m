This bio is blk-mq IO which is underlying bio of DM or bio based driver, so
they doesn't belong to DM or bio based driver. Actually the bio_endio()
is called by blk_update_request().

The patch just tracks underlying bio-mq bios in current context, then
poll them until all are done.

This patch stores bio->bi_end_io(shared with ->bi_poll) into one per-task
data structure, and links all bios sharing same .bi_end_io into one list
via ->bi_end_io. And their ->bi_end_io is recovered before calling
bio_endio().

The helper is used for checking if one bio can be added to bio group,
and storing the data. The helper just serves for document purpose.

And the type info doesn't matter.
