Hi Shinichiro,

Thanks for your test!

Then I think the following change should make the difference actually,
you may double check that and confirm if it is that.

However, the flush request is added to tail of dispatch queue[1] for long time.
0cacba6cf825 ("blk-mq-sched: bypass the scheduler for flushes entirely")
and its predecessor(all mq scheduler start patches) changed to add flush request
to front of dispatch queue for blk-mq by ignoring 'add_queue' parameter of
blk_mq_sched_insert_flush(). That change may be by accident, and not sure it is
correct.

I guess once flush rq is added to tail of dispatch queue in block/004,
in which lots of FS request may stay in hctx->dispatch because of low
AHCI queue depth, then we may take a bit long for flush rq to be
submitted to LLD.

I'd suggest to root cause/understand the issue given it isn't obvious
correct to queue flush rq at front of dispatch queue, so could you collect
the following trace via the following script with/without the single line
patch?

#!/bin/sh

MAJ=$1
MIN=$2
MAJ=$(( $MAJ << 20 ))
DEV=$(( $MAJ | $MIN ))

/usr/share/bcc/tools/trace -t -C \
    't:block:block_getrq (args->dev == '$DEV') "%s %d %d", args->rwbs, args->sector, args->nr_sector' \
    't:block:block_rq_issue (args->dev == '$DEV') "%s %d %d", args->rwbs, args->sector, args->nr_sector' \
    't:block:block_rq_complete (args->dev == '$DEV') "%s %d %d", args->rwbs, args->sector, args->nr_sector'

note:
1) install bcc package
2) pass the test disk(AHCI/SMR) major & minor to above script
3) start the script before running block/004



[1] 53d63e6b0dfb block: make the flush insertion use the tail of the dispatch list

Thanks,
Ming
