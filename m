Well, just received my H700 today, plugged it in, not everything is perfect
because I'm missing a cable, but sure enough, my rebuild speeds got 8 times
faster and the system stopped hanging all the time if I do any I/O.

I still think there was something fairly unexpected/wrong with the Perc 5/i
outside of it being a cheap card, but I have other things to worry about to
spend more time to find out :)
That said, if anyone wants the card for cost of shipping (US only please,
shipping abroad is too much of a pain), let me know and I'll give it to you.
