Note that the nvme io_uring passthrough patches also want a non-kiocb
cached alloc version.  That code isn't quite ready yet but shows we'll
need something there as well.

Yes, an uring deals with making sure they are freed in the same place.

The name sounds good fine, and I just it would be best done by
lifting BIO_PERCPU_CACHE to the REQ_ namespace and ensure it is
cleared by the bio allocator if the percpu cache isn't actually
used.
