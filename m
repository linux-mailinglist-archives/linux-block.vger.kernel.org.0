The waiting depends on CPU and device's speed, if device is quicker than
CPU, the wait should be longer. Testing in one environment is usually
not enough.

What I meant is that the bio returned from bio_split() is only for
io accounting. Yeah, the comment said it can be for io completion too,
but that is easily done without the splitted bio.

That patch shows we can avoid the extra split, also shows that the
splitted bio from bio_split() is for io accounting only.
