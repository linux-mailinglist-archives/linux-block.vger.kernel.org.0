Hi all,

we have had a problem for a while where the number of segments that
the bvec iterators will iterate over don't match the value in
req->nr_phys_segments, causing problems for anyone looking at
nr_phys_segments and iterating over bvec directly instead of using
blk_rq_map_sg.  The first patch in this series fixes this by
making sure nr_phys_segments matches the actual number of segments.
Drivers using blk_rq_map_sg will still get the lower number returned
from function eventually, but the fact that we don't reduce the
value earlier will not allow some merges that we might otherwise
allow.

With that in place I also noticed that we do not properly account
segements sizes on devices with a virt_boundary, but it turns out that
segment sizes fundamentally don't make sense for such devices, as their
"segment" is a fixed size "device page", and not a variable sized
scatter/gather elements as in the block layer, so we make that fact
formal.

Once all that is sorted out it is pretty clear that there is no
good reason to have the front/back segement accounting to start
with.

Changes since v2:
  - fix some fixes tags

Changes since v1:
  - update a commit log
  - add fixes tags
  - drop the follow on patches not suitable for 5.2
