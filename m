The principle behind blk_mq_find_and_get_req() is that if one request's
ref is grabbed, the queue's usage counter is guaranteed to be grabbed,
and this way isn't straight-forward.

Yeah, it can fix the issue, but I don't think it is good to call it in
fast path cause tags->lock is required.

No, blk_mq_freeze_queue() waits until .q_usage_counter becomes zero, so
there won't be any concurrent nbd_read_stat() during switching elevator
if ->q_usage_counter is grabbed in recv_work().
