Well I would typically agree... however... 

It is in no way shape or form, not even in the blktrace documentation
that the request_queue / and therefore blktrace is shared between
partitions. Likewise for scsi-generic and say its respective block
device for TYPE_BLOCK.

If it is not obvious to some developer, it won't be obvious to users.
So *why* this fails really today is a mystery to users.

These limitations to the design of blktrace is not well documented
at all.

I think so as well.

Thanks for Bart for pointing it out!
