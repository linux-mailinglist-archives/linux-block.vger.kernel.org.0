That commit made it into 5.11-rc, and other SCSI HBA expose HW queues in 
5.10 and earlier. But then this series is targeted at 5.12.

Question: can we consider backport this series just due to performance 
issue regression? I'd say no, but maybe someone strongly disagrees with 
me ...

Thanks,
John
