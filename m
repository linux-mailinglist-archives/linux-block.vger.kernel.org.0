Hi Gregory, John, Jonathan and Dan:
	Thanx for your information, they help a lot, and sorry for the late reply.

After some internal discussions, I think we can design it as follows:

(1) If the hardware implements cache coherence, then the software layer 
doesn't need to consider this issue, and can perform read and write 
operations directly.

(2) If the hardware doesn't implement cache coherence, we can consider a 
DMA-like approach, where we check architectural features to determine if 
cache coherence is supported. This could be similar to 
`dev_is_dma_coherent`.

Additionally, if the architecture supports flushing and invalidating CPU 
caches (`CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SYNC_DMA_FOR_DEVICE`, 
`CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SYNC_DMA_FOR_CPU`, 
`CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SYNC_DMA_FOR_CPU_ALL`),

then we can handle cache coherence at the software layer.
(For the clean writeback issue, I think it may also require 
clarification from the architecture, and how DMA handles the clean 
writeback problem, which I haven't further checked.)

(3) If the hardware doesn't implement cache coherence and the cpu 
doesn't support the required CPU cache operations, then we can run in 
nocache mode.

CBD can initially support (3), and then transition to (1) when hardware 
supports cache-coherency. If there's sufficient market demand, we can 
also consider supporting (2).

How does this approach sound?

Thanx
