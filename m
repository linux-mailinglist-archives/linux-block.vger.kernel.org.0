Thanks a lot for your detailed explanation.

We found that removing scsi device will delay a long time (such as 6 * 30s)
for waiting the other device in the same host to complete all IOs, where
some IO retry multiple times. If our driver allowed more times to retry,
removing device will wait longer. That is not expected.

In fact, that is not problem before switching scsi blk-mq. All target
devices are independent when removing.

Thanks,
Yufen
