I mean,

assuming PR_SET_IO_FLUSHER is already set on Thread A by using prctl,
but since it can call any valid system call, therefore, after it
received data due to direct reclaim and writeback, it is still
allowed to call some system call which may do something as follows:

   Thread A (PR_SET_IO_FLUSHER)   Kernel thread B (another context)

   (call some syscall which)

   submit something to Thread B
                                  
                                  ... (do something)

                                  memory allocation with GFP_KERNEL (it
                                  may trigger direct memory reclaim
                                  again and reenter the original fs.)

                                  wake up Thread A

   wait Thread B to complete

Normally such system call won't cause any problem since userspace
programs cannot be in a context out of writeback and direct reclaim.
Yet I'm not sure if it works under userspace block driver
writeback/direct reclaim cases.

Yes, all in-kernel driver implementations needs to be audited with
proper memory allocation with GFP_NOIO, but userspace programs are
allowed to call any system call. And such system call can rely on
another process context with can do __GFP_FS allocation again.
