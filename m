I agree, this really does feel underspecified, as there is no way to
actually know which smc interfaces are available, or which ones belong
to a particular driver. Simply calling them is not that different from
using an ioremap() on a hardwired physical address just because you
know where a device is on a given SoC. Or another way of looking at
it is that these are function calls that are arbitrarily moved out from
the kernel into a piece of (usually) closed source software running on
the same chip.

A first step toward managing this better might be to enforce namespaces
of the smc calls, if we can find a way to limit arm_smccc_smc() calls
those that have the first argument defined in a central header file.
