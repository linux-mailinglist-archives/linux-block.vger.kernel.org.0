It's not as simple as that.  There are some SCSI devices that support
WRITE ZEROES, but do not return the MAXIMUM WRITE SAME LENGTH in the
block device limits VPD page.  So, some commands might work, and others
might not.  In particular, a commonly-used hypervisor does this.

The sd driver disables the use of write same if certain errors are
returned (INVALID COMMAND w/ INVALID COMMAND OPCODE or INVALID FIELD IN
CDB), but if you do a blkdiscard -z of an entire drive a whole lot of
bios/requests are already queued by the time you get that.

Higher level code checks to see if write zeroes is supported, and
won't queue the requests once it is turned off, but that doesn't
happen until a command fails.  We also check in command setup, see
my earlier patch which deals with spurious blk_update_request errors
if the disablement of write same gets detected there...  I explicitly
did not try to fix that by "testing" with one bio for the reason
Christoph mentions.
