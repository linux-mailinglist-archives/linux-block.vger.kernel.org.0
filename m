Thanks for your patient.
As you comment in bfq_idle_slice_timer, there are two race situations as follows,
a) bfqq is null
   bfq_idle_slice_timer will not call bfq_idle_slice_timer_body ->no problem
b) bfqq are not in service
   1) bfqq is freed
      it will cause use-after-free problem before calling bfq_clear_bfqq_wait_request
      in bfq_idle_slice_timer_body. -> use-after-free problem as analyzed in the patch.
   2) bfqq is not freed
      it means in_service_queue has been set to a new bfqq. The old bfqq has been expired
      through __bfq_bfqq_expire func. Then the wait_request flags of old bfqq will be cleared
      in __bfq_bfqd_reset_in_service func. -> it is no a problem to re-clear the wait_request
      flags before checking whether bfqq is in service.

In one word, the old bfqq in race has already cleared the wait_request flag when switching in_service_queue.

Thanks,
Zhiqiang Liu
