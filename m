We would like to have an async() passthru I/O path and it seems possible
to do through uring. As mentioned on the other email, the goal is to
have the I/O go through the block layer for better integration, but this
work is still ongoing. See other thread.

In order to enable (2), we need the device to come up first. At the
moment the NVMe driver rejects ZNS devices without append support, so
either ioctl() or the uring path will not work.
