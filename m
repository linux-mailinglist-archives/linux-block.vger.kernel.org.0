Mike,

I would like to clarify some points that I've made, and also try 
to repair the damage from the misunderstandings that I think have occured.

First of all, I actually meant the feedback on Hannes's patch which was
sent on the 19th of November:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20201119164924.74401-1-hare@suse.de/

Your feedback from the 18th of November ("[PATCH 4/4] dm_interposer - 
Try to use blk_interpose in dm") is very valuable, but I am not sure that
I am currently capable of implementing the proposed DM changes.
The overall architecture of DM is still not clear to me, and I am studying
it right now.

This new patch (the one that Hannes sent on the 19th of November) is also
compatibile with DM and should not pose any problems - the architecture is
the same. There are some changes that make blk_interposer simpler and better,
plus the sample is added.

Glad to hear that! In order to avoid the additional copying one can only
change an intercepted bio, which might be dangerous.

I just think that no one can implement integration of DM with
blk_interposer better than dm-devel team. I will certainly try my best,
but I am afraid that such efforts will only produce incongruous
DM patches that will be a waste of time (yours and mine).

I am very sorry that I undercut your enthusiasm, but, as you rightly
pointed out, another development windows is closing, and my product
is still not able to work on newer Linux versions starting from 5.8.
That fact makes me particularly sad and forces me to search for different
means to draw some attention to blk_interposer. I've seen an RHEL 8.4
alpha recently, all looks very cool there but made me even more sad ...

Also I certainly remember a separate email that was sent to you on the
7th of December. Maybe it should have been written in the already
existing thread instead.

I want it too. However, there is a certain difficulty with usage of DM
for backup copying. For instance, there is no changed block tracking (CBT)
and right now I don't have any clue how it could be implemented
considering the existing architecture. I still hope that sometime
in future I could be offer my blk-snap module which was specifically
created for backup copying purposes.

I apologize for causing all that confusion and mess and making you upset.
I hope that all of the above makes sense to you and you will not think
that I was slacking and tried to offload all the work to your team.
