Can you elaborate on what you think the actual problem is here?  The lifetime of
the blk_crypto_profile matches that of the host controller kobject, and I
thought that it is not destroyed until after higher-level objects such as
gendisks and request_queues are destroyed.  Similar assumptions are made by the
queue kobject, which assumes it is safe to access the gendisk, and by the
independent_access_ranges kobject which assumes it is safe to access the queue.

I suppose this wouldn't have worked with the original sysfs design where opening
a file in sysfs actually got a refcount to the kobject.  But that's long gone,
having been changed in Linux v2.6.23 (https://lwn.net/Articles/229774).

Note that commit 20f01f163203 which added this code got an "all looks good" from
Greg KH (https://lore.kernel.org/r/YaH1CmHClx5WvDWD@kroah.com).  I'd have hoped
that he would've noticed if there was a major problem with how kobjects are used
here!  Greg, would you mind taking a look at this part again?

In any case, this proposal is not correct since it is assuming that each
blk_crypto_profile is referenced by only one request_queue, which is not
necessarily the case since a host controller can have multiple disks.
The same kobject can't be added to multiple places in the hierarchy.

If we did need to do something differently here, I think we'd either need to put
the blk_crypto_profile kobject under the host controller one and link to it from
the queue directories (which I mentioned in commit 20f01f163203 as an
alternative considered), or duplicate the crypto capabilities in each
request_queue and only share the actual keyslot management data structures.
