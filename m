According to aliases attempts, I think those have failed, mainly
because of two reasons.

1. Arguments stating that LABELs/UUIDs are variable alternatives. This
isn't the case, which I think was also concluded from the several
earlier discussions.
2. Patches that tried adding support for mmc aliases, were not
correctly coded. More precisely, what needs to be addressed is that
the mmc core also preserves the same ids to be set for the host class
as the block device, mmc[n] must correspond to mmcblk[n].

Lots of time during the years I have been approached, both publicly
and offlist, about whether it would be possible to add support for
"consistent" mmcblk devices. To me, I am fine with the aliases
approach, as long as it gets implemented correctly.
