Already subscribed :)

I don't mean to hijack this thread, but JFYI we're getting around to 
test https://github.com/ming1/linux/commits/v5.2-rc-host-tags-V2 - 
unfortunately we're still seeing a performance regression. I can't see 
where it's coming from. We're double-checking the test though.

Thanks,
John
