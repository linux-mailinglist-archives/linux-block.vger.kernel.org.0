Because they don't provide much benefit once implemented and the
implementation is a bit many tentacled.  The point of implementation
driven specs isn't to declare it's great when you get to any old
implementation, however horrible, just because you can force one of
your employees to produce it, it's to fail fast and do something better
when the implementation proves problematic.  The kernel patch process
can provide the failure, but it's much less traumatic if the original
implementors recognize it before it gets spec'd.

Just because something exists in hardware is no reason to use it as the
fact that we use < 10% of the SCSI spec most hardware speaks will
attest.
