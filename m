Hi Leon,

I saw only now that you replied to this old thread recently, which looks
a lot like what I reported independently yesterday:

This sounds like you could reproduce the problem with an actual network
connection, going over TCP to another host? This is an interesting
addition for me, because I only saw it with local unix domain sockets.

My conclusion was that we hit one of the code paths where a partially
completed request gets requeued (and then assigned a new tag when it
runs the next time).

Maybe you want to test the patch (v3) Ming suggested in the other thread
on your setup? The problem doesn't reproduce for me any more with it,
but I suppose more testing can't hurt.
