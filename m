If the failed commands are retried, they will be requeued and you will not see
the error as the request will not be completed yet, no ? And if you do see the
error back in the block layer, you cannot just retry the command at will. The
issuer must do that, no ? I am confused...

Please send patches to discuss based on code. That will be easier.
