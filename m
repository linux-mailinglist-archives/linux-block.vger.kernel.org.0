Thanks for the script. I'll try a few different combinations of dd
involving the UFS card to see if I can at least remove the system disk
from the equation. Hopefully the system will still be responsive
enough to run the script if I keep it in the right place and maybe
pre-warm it up. I also might try an older kernel, since if it's a
misbehaving block device as you suggest then all kernel versions
should lock up.
