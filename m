We know the exact theory for non-managed interrupt, can you share us
any issue you want to avoid?

CPU hotplug isn't related with nvme reset at all, which is just for
recovering nvme controller to make it working again. How can cpu offline
affect nvme controller?

For NVMe PCI, blk-mq have drained any inflight requests before the hctx
is becoming inactive.

For other NVMe controller which doesn't use managed irq, the inflight
requests can still be completed via the original interrupt, or polling
task, both can been migrated to new online cpu.

I don't know what exact race conditions you are talking about. Please
explain it in details, otherwise it just wastes our time.

No, you didn't provide any proof about the necessity of adding the sync.
