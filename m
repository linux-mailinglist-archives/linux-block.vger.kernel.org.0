I believe all current drivers set .can_queue as single hw queue's depth.
If you set .can_queue as HISI_SAS_MAX_COMMANDS which is HBA's queue
depth, the hisilicon sas driver will HISI_SAS_MAX_COMMANDS * nr_hw_queues
in-flight requests.

OK, what I meant is to use correct driver to test the patches, otherwise
it might be hard to investigate.
