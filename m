So hctx->dispatch_busy isn't set as true in this case?

At default BFQ's queue depth is same with virtblk_queue_depth, both are
256, so looks you use non-default setting?

Also in case of running out of driver tag, hctx->dispatch_busy should have
been set as true for avoiding batching dequeuing, does the following
patch make a difference for you?
