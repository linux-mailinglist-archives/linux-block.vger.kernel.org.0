Okay, that's a reasonable argument for logging the rule along with the
decision.  I think it helps that the IPE policy rules are not
particularly long.

I'm not sure that's necessary, and honestly it might be annoying as we
would still need to output a 'rule=3D"?"' field in the audit record as
it is considered good practice to not have fields magically appear and
disappear from the record format.  However, if there are concerns
about record sizes, that could be a potential mitigation.
