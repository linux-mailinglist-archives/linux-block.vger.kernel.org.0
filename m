I haven't taken a close look at the code yet so far, but one quick note
that patches like this should be against the branches for 5.11. In fact,
this one doesn't even compile against current -git, as
blk_mq_bio_list_merge is now called blk_bio_list_merge.

In any case, I did run this through some quick peak testing as I was
curious, and I'm seeing about 20% drop in peak IOPS over none running
this. Perf diff:

    10.71%     -2.44%  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] read_tsc
     2.33%     -1.99%  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] _raw_spin_lock

Also:

Was curious and wanted to look it up, but it doesn't exist.
