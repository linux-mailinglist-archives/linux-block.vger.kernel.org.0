( Sorry for sending this mail again,  I am not sure you saw that for the =
last one was not in pure text format.)

Hi all,

In short, Ming=E2=80=99s patchset was tested against kernel master and =
works well.  Tested-by: lining <lining2020x@163.com>=20


The iops limit test result on thin-dm lv shows quite perfect and IO was =
much more smooth during the testing, very cool!=20

The origin issue is #bz2027241 named `cgroup2: wiops limit doesn't work =
when doing sequential write on a thin provisioned lv`,
There are more details about this issue and patch work in this bugzilla =
ticket [1].

Follows my test result and test script (iops was limit to 10 in my =
case):
- dm thin case test result: https://pastebin.com/raw/VgvB2TFY
- dm plain case test result: https://pastebin.com/raw/UVZMYjTp
- test script: https://pastebin.com/raw/YXEDH6Ss
