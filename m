Yeah, I already looked in to that and discounted it.
We want to support dynamic swapfile sizing, which means files, not statically reserved regions of disk.
Besides, if static regions were suitable for our design, we could just use partitions instead.

At this point, we accept that any sort of mapping over the top of dependable extents is just not
going to happen. And Based on the discussions from your previous attempt
 https://lore.kernel.org/dm-devel/7d6ae2c9-df8e-50d0-7ad6-b787cb3cfab4@redhat.com/
I can definitely agree with the fs folks why it makes sense to avoid that approach.

I think instead we'll go looking at ancyrpting swap data during swap out.
zswap exists as a permutation of data during swap in/out. I suspect we could do
something with encryption in a similar manner (to be investigated).

Thanks for the discussion, was interesting diving in to it.
