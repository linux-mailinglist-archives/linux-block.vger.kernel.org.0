If the host really wants to write in small granularities, then larger
block sizes just shifts the write amplification from the device to the
host, which seems worse than letting the device deal with it.

I've done some early profiling on my fleet and there are definitely
applications that overwhelming prefer larger writes. Those should be
great candidates to use these kinds of logical block formats. It's
already flash-friendly, but aligning filesystems and memory management
to the same granularity is a nice plus.

Other applications, though, still need 4k writes. Turning those to RMW
on the host to modify 4k in the middle of a 16k block is obviously a bad
fit.

Anyway, your mileage may vary. This example BPF program provides an okay
starting point for examining disk usage to see if large logical block
sizes are a good fit for your application:
