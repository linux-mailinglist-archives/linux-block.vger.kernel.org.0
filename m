Got it, looks a good use case for compression, but not has to be QCOW2.

This image can be compressed via xz, and fetched via wget or what
ever. 'xz' could have better compression ratio than qcow2, I guess.

You still need to update losetup.  xz-utils can be installed for
decompressing the image, then you still can create loop disk over
the image.

As I mentioned above, seems not necessary to introduce loop-qcow2.
