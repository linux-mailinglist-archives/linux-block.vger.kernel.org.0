OK, I tried a bisect (2 days compilations...).
Assuming I've done everything correctly (how to
test this? How to remove the guilty patch?), this
was the result:

09324d32d2a0843e66652a087da6f77924358e62 is the first bad commit
commit 09324d32d2a0843e66652a087da6f77924358e62

    block: force an unlimited segment size on queues with a virt boundary

    We currently fail to update the front/back segment size in the bio when
    deciding to allow an otherwise gappy segement to a device with a
    virt boundary.  The reason why this did not cause problems is that
    devices with a virt boundary fundamentally don't use segments as we
    know it and thus don't care.  Make that assumption formal by forcing
    an unlimited segement size in this case.

What to do now?

Thanks,
