With blk-mq, which all drivers are these days, the request memory is
statically allocated when the driver is setup. I'm not denying that you
could very well have issued AND completed the request which 'last'
points to by the time we dereference it, but that won't be a UAF unless
the device has also been quiesced and removed in between. Which I guess
could indeed be a possibility since it is by definition on a different
queue (->multiple_queues would be true, however, but that's also what
would be required to reach that far into that statement).

This is different from the older days of a request being literally freed
when it completes, which is what I initially reacted to.

As mentioned in the original reply, I do think we should just clear
'last' as you suggest. But it's not something we've seen on the FB fleet
of servers, even with the majority of hosts running this code (and on
VMs).
