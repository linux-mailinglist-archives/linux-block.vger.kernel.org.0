In current way, when io2 is done, io tickes should be 5, since 1 tick
is added for two io start.

Before commit 5b18b5a73760("block: delete part_round_stats and switch to less precise counting"),
io tick is calculated accurately, which is basically:

	(4 - 0) + (5 - 4) + (8 - 5) = 8

Linux kernel's comment style is '/**/'

Looks this way of only sampling IO done is smart, io ticks becomes much
more accurate than before.

jiffies and req->start_time_ns may be from different clock sources, so
I'd suggest to merge the two patches into one.
