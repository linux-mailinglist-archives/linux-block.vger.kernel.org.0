I helped debug the crash with Stefan and I think this is the most
straightforward fix (and is trivial to backport for stable kernels). I
looked at delaying the queue allocation in the dm code until the table
load ioctl but I decided that was risky and doesn't help the general
case of preventing other subsystems from making this same mistake.
