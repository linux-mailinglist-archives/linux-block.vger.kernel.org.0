Although we can do special processing for connect_q, fabrics_q, admin_q,
but this results in redundant semantics being implemented in
nvme_xxx_teardown_io_queues, these actions are confused for
nvme_xxx_teardown_admin_queue. It doesn't look clear.
Therefor, I think quiesceing queues based on namespaces is a better option.
In addition, I do not see the benefit of quiesceing queues based on tagset.
