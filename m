Maybe that wasn't quite clear, what I'm trying to say is that there are
two outcomes with IORING_OP_TIMEOUT:

1) The number of events specified in the timeout is met. This happens
   through the normal poll command checks when we complete commands.
2) The timer fires. When this happens, we just increment ->cq_timeouts.
   You'd have to make a note of that in the poll loop just like we do in
   cqring_wait() to know to abort if that value is different from when
   we started the loop.

All that's needed to support timeouts with IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL is to
have that ->cq_timeouts check in place. With that, the restriction could
be lifted.
