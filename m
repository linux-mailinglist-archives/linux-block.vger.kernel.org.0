Think you have your example messed up still.  RAID 10+2 with 128K
chunk_sectors, 1280K full stripe (io_opt). Then thinp stacked ontop of
it with chunk_sectors of 1280K was usecase that wasn't supported before.

So stacked chunk_sectors = min_not_zero(128K, 1280K) = 128K

Sure, think we both agree lcm_not_zero() shouldn't be used.

RAID6 with chunk_sectors of 1280K is pretty insane...
And yet you're saying full device IO is 1280K...
So something still isn't adding up.

Anyway, if we run with your example of chunk_sectors (512K, 1280K), yes
there is serious potential for IO to span the RAID6 layer's chunk_sector
boundary.

Yeap, I see.

But your chunk_sectors (512K, 1280K) example is a misconfigured IO
stack.  Really not sure it worth being concerned about it.

Kind of on the fence on this... think I'd like to get Martin's take.

Using gcd() instead of min_not_zero() to stack chunk_sectors isn't a big
deal; given the nature of chunk_sectors coupled with it being able to be
a non-power-of-2 _does_ add a new wrinkle.

So you had a valid point all along, just that you made me work pretty
hard to understand you.

Eh, I need to build my pain threshold back up.. been away from it all
for more than a week.. ;)
