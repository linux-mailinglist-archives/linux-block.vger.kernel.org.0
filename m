Sorry, but no.  Again, platform devices are ONLY for actual platform
devices, not "things on a device that happens to be on another bus
device".  Like PCI devices.

That is what the auxiliary bus code was written for, please read
Documentation/driver-api/auxiliary_bus.rst for how to use it.

Email works best, video chats for every patch review does not scale at
