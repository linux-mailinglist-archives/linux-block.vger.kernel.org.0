Hi Shakeel,

We use the PSI tracepoints in our kernel to analyze the individual
latency caused by memory pressure, but the PSI tracepoints are
implemented with a new version as bellow:
    trace_psi_memstall_enter(_RET_IP_);
    trace_psi_memstall_leave(_RET_IP_);
And then using the _RET_IP_ to identify the specific PSI type.

If the _RET_IP_ is at try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages(), then it means
the pressure caused by the memory cgroup, IOW, the limit of memcg is
reached and it has to do memcg reclaim. Otherwise we can consider it
as global memory pressure.
try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages
    psi_memstall_enter
        if (static_branch_likely(&psi_disabled))
            return;
        *flags = current->in_memstall;
         if (*flags)
             return;
         trace_psi_memstall_enter(_RET_IP_);  <<<<< memcg pressure
