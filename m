There are lots of unbalanced usage in nvme, such as

1) nvme pci:

- nvme_dev_disable() can be called more than one times before starting
reset, so multiple nvme_stop_queues() vs. single nvme_start_queues().

2) Forcibly unquiesce queues in nvme_kill_queues() even though queues
are never quiesced, and similar usage can be seen in tcp/fc/rdma too

Once the quiesce and unquiesce are run from difference context, it becomes
not easy to audit if the two is done in pair.



Thanks,
Ming
