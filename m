Hi Jan!
as I happened to tell you moths ago, I feared some likely cover case
to show up eventually.  Actually, I was even more pessimistic than how
reality proved to be :)

I'm sorry for my delay, but I've had to think about this issue for a
while.  Being too strict would easily run out journald as a waker for
processes belonging to a different group.

So, what do you think of this proposal: add the extra filter that a
waker must belong to the same group of the woken, or, at most, to the
root group?

Thanks,
Paolo
