This is nvme, actual device. The initial posting could be a bit more
explicit on the use case, it says:

"For NVMe SSDs, the i10 I/O scheduler achieves ~60% improvements in
terms of IOPS per core over "noop" I/O scheduler."

which made me very skeptical, as it sounds like it's raw device claims.

Does beg the question of why this is a new scheduler then. It's pretty
basic stuff, something that could trivially just be added a side effect
of the core (and in fact we have much of it already). Doesn't really seem
to warrant a new scheduler at all. There isn't really much in there.

That works, my local results were a bit worse than listed in there though.
And what does this mean:

"We note that Linux I/O scheduler introduces an additional kernel worker
thread at the I/O dispatching stage"

It most certainly does not for the common/hot case.
