Feel free to go ahead and suggest an alternative solution that shows the 
same performance benefits.It is open-source, and if you can show and 
_implement_ a better solution. We will review it as any other 
contribution to the open-source eco-system.

First a note: I appreciate you bringing up discussions that was made 
within the NVMe ZNS TG, but please note that those discussions happened 
in that forum that is under NDA. This is an open-source mailing list, 
and the content will be available online for many many years. Please 
refrain from discussing things that are not deemed public by the the 
NVMe board of directors.

On your statement, there is no deliberate locking out of devices , no 
more than a specific feature has not been implemented or that a device 
driver that is properitary to a company. Everyone is free to contribute 
to open-source. As Javier has previously pointed out, he intends to 
submit a patchset to add the necessary support for the zone append 
command API.
