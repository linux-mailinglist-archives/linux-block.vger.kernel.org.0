In general you have a valid point, that blk_queue_split() won't have
been done for the suspended device case, but blk_queue_split() cannot be
used if not in ->submit_bio -- IIUC you cannot just do it from a worker
thread and hope to have proper submission order (depth first) as
provided by __submit_bio_noacct().  Because this IO will be submitted
from worker you could have multiple threads allocating from the
q->bio_split mempool at the same time.

All said, I'm not quite sure how to address this report.  But I'll keep
at it and see what I can come up with.

Thanks,
Mike
