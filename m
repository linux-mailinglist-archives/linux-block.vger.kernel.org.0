Why do you need a 128-bit non-cryptographic hash algorithm?  What problem are
you trying to solve?

Well, this commit doesn't mention that the choice was forced for compatibility
reasons.

It sounds like the on-disk format (and presumably the UAPI, too?) for dm-vdo was
already set in stone before it was ever sent out for review.

That takes away some motivation to bother reviewing it, since many review
comments will be met with "we won't change this"...
