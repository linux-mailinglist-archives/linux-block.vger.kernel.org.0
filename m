Subject: [PATCH 0/7] bcache patches for Linux 5.13 -- 1st wave

Hi Jens,

This is the 1st wave of bcache for Linux v5.13.
All the patches in this submission are all about code cleanup or
minor fixes.

The 2nd wave patches are about the NVDIMM support on bcache which were
held in previous merge window. The refined patches work as expected, and
I am waiting Intel developers to post the update version with the fixes
of the integration testing. Then I will post out the 2nd wave bcache
patches for 5.13 merge window.

Thanks in advance for taking the 1st wave patches.

Coly Li
