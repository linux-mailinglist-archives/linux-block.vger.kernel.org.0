Hi Hannes,
This code is for specific family of megaraid_sas adapters and Lenovo
RAID 930-8i belongs to them. For those adapters, we want to use
available HW queues in round robin fashion instead of using interrupt
affinity. It helps to improve performance and fixes soft lockups.
For interrupt affinity test purpose on Lenovo RAID 930-8i, you can
disable this code to use affinity. But in the final patch, this code
has to be present. This code was added through below commit:

commit 1d15d9098ad12b0021ac5a6b851f26d1ab021e5a
Author: Shivasharan S <shivasharan.srikanteshwara@broadcom.com>

    scsi: megaraid_sas: Load balance completions across all MSI-X

    Driver will use "reply descriptor post queues" in round robin fashion w=
hen
    the combined MSI-X mode is not enabled. With this IO completions are
    distributed and load balanced across all the available reply descriptor
    post queues equally.

    This is enabled only if combined MSI-X mode is not enabled in firmware.
    This improves performance and also fixes soft lockups.

    When load balancing is enabled, IRQ affinity from driver needs to be
    disabled.
