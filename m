The same was true for CDL and it got in anyway.  And yes, CDL on ATA
is a complete f**king mess, and needs to be fixed.  So ATA needs to byte
the bullet and extent the FIS anyway, so we might as well get started on
it ASAP.  Fortunately the only implementations that really matter now
are AHCI and SAS expanders, so it sounds very doable to get there.

There is so many features in SCSI and not ATA, most notably protection
information that this sounds like a BS argument to me.  That being
said supporting Zone Append and properly doing CDL in ATA would be
very useful.
