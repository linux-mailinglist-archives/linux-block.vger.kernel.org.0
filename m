It is easy for .nr_phys_segments to reach the max segment limit by this
way, then no new bio can be merged any more.

We don't consider segment merge between two bios in ll_new_hw_segment(),
in my mkfs test over virtio-blk, request size can be increased to ~1M(several
segments) from 63k(126 bios/segments) easily if the segment merge between
two bios is considered.

Seems discard segment doesn't consider bios merge for nvme and virtio,
so it should be fine in this way. Will take a close look at nvme/virtio
discard segment merge later.
