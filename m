Subject: [PATCH] Provide detailed specification of virtio-blk lifetime metrics
From:   Enrico Granata <egranata@google.com>

In the course of review, some concerns were surfaced about the
original virtio-blk lifetime proposal, as it depends on the eMMC
spec which is not open

Add a more detailed description of the meaning of the fields
added by that proposal to the virtio-blk specification, as to
make it feasible to understand and implement the new lifetime
metrics feature without needing to refer to JEDEC's specification

This patch does not change the meaning of those fields nor add
any new fields, but it is intended to provide an open and more
clear description of the meaning associated with those fields.
