Yes I agree and personally I like static key very much as it's lightweight. 
And I also liked the way you used it in IO hotpath so that we avoid cost of
fetching q->rq_qos when not needed. 
Having said that, I also tried Ming's suggestion but that didn't work out
due to the fact that "cpu_hotplug_lock is widely used across various kernel
subsystems— not just in CPU hotplug-specific paths. There are several code
paths outside of the hotplug core that acquire cpu_hotplug_lock and subsequently
perform memory allocations using GFP_KERNEL". So essentially adopting to use
GFP_NOIO in cpu hotplug code may not help. You might have missed my reply to
Ming's suggestion, you may refer it here:

Yes I sent out v2 just for fixing minor things in the original patch as I
outlined it in the v2 changelog.
