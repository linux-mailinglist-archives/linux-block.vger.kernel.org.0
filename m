Thanks for looking the way. I agree the single zram_index_rwlock is
not the right approach to fix it. However, I still hope we find more
generic solution to fix them at once since I see it's zram instance
racing problem.

A approach I am considering is to make struct zram include kobject
and then make zram sysfs auto populated under the kobject. So, zram/sysfs
lifetime should be under the kobject. With it, sysfs race probem I
mentioned above should be gone. Furthermore, zram_remove should fail
if one of the alive zram objects is existing
(i.e., zram->kobject->refcount > 1) so module_exit will fail, too.

I see one of the problems is how I could make new zram object's
attribute group for zram knobs under /sys/block/zram0 since block
layer already made zram0 kobject via device_add_disk.
