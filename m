Will NVMe HDD support multiple NS? If yes, this queue depth isn't
enough, given all NSs share this single host queue depth.

Suppose NVMe HDD just wants to support single NS and there is single queue,
if the device just reports one host queue depth, block layer IO sort/merge
can only be done when there is device saturation feedback provided.

So, looks either NS queue depth or per-NS device saturation feedback
mechanism is needed, otherwise NVMe HDD may have to do internal IO
sort/merge.
