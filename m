Yeah, it is true.

Yeah, it is NULL just in case of memory allocation failure.

But where to store the submitting context in bio? pid is 32bit and we can
pass it from submit_bio() perfectly, then avoid to add anything to bio.

If we save the submitting context in bio, we still have to handle task
exit related race, not see any benefit.

So far bio is ~128byte with typical setting, and people usually hate to
add more stuff into bio.

> find_get_task_by_vpid in the poll context seems rather problematic.

Why? We already handle submit context early exit.

That is hard to do because of race between submission and completion:

1) HIPRI could be cleared because of bio splitting, so we can't do that
for this kind of bio

2) we have to make sure that the bio won't be completed when storing
cookie into this bio. BIO_END_BY_POLL is added in this patch for bio
based polling. You mean we may cover all normal blk-mq polling via
BIO_END_BY_POLL?
