Which DM driver is it ? Does that DM driver have some special work queue
handling of BIO submissions ? Or does is simply remap the BIO and send it down
to the underlying device in the initial submit_bio() context ? If it is the
former case, then that DM driver must enable zone write plugging. If it is the
latter, it should not need zone write plugging and ordering will be handled
correctly throughout the submit_bio() context for the initial DM BIO, assuming
that the submitter does indeed serialize write BIO submissions to a zone. I have
not looked at f2fs code in ages. When I worked on it, there was a mutex to
serialize write issuing to avoid reordering issues...

As mentioned above, the splitting and adding to the zone write plug should all
be serialized by the submitter, using whatever mean is appropriate there. As
long as submit_bio() is ongoing processing a large BIO and splitting it, if the
submitter is correctly serialzing writes, I do not see how splitting can result
in reordering...

I asked for clarification in the first place because I still do not understand
what is going on reading that lightly explained backtrace you show in that
email. A more detailed time flow explanation of what is happening and in which
context would very likely clarify exactly what is gong on.

So far, the only thing I can think of is that maybe we need to split BIOs in DM
core before submitting them to the DM driver. But I am reluctant to send such
patch because I cannot justify/expalin its need based on your explanations.
