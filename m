Hi Jens,

These are my arguments in favor of having this functionality in the 
block layer core instead of in the UFS driver:
* This functionality is useful for multiple block drivers. It is also
   useful for  block drivers with a max_segment_size limit less than 64
   KiB on systems with a 64 KiB page size. E.g. the sbp2 driver and
   several ATA and MMC drivers set the max_segment_size limit to a value
   less than 64 KiB.
* The UFS 3.1 devices in my test setup support read bandwidths up to 2
   GiB/s and more than 100K IOPS. UFSHCI 4.0 controllers support a link
   bandwidth that is the double of UFSHCI 3.x controllers and also
   support higher queue depths (up to 512 instead of 32). In other words,
   performance matters for UFS devices. Having the SCSI core build an SG
   list and making the UFS driver rework that SG list probably would
   affect performance negatively.
* The MMC driver is more complicated than needed because the block layer
   core does not yet support the limits of MMC devices. I think that this
   patch series will allow to simplify the MMC driver. From
   drivers/mmc/block.c:

	/*
	 * The block layer doesn't support all sector count
	 * restrictions, so we need to be prepared for too big
	 * requests.
	 */

* Care has been taken not to affect performance or maintainability
   of the block layer core in a negative way.

Thanks,

Bart.
