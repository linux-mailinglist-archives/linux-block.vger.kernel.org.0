According to the user it is not part of a server motherboard but a
"proper" PCIe Broadcom SAS 9300-8i HBA.

Yeah, I agree checking the latest firmware makes sense for these,
unfortunately they are currently in use so the user cannot test with them.

But we might be able to run some tests with a Supermicro
AOC-S3816L-L16iT (so Broadcom SAS3816?) soon where the hotplug issue
apparently also happens. We'll make sure to update to the latest
firmware and I'll do my best to collect relevant logs. If you can think
of anything specific we should collect, feel free to let me know.

Right, this would make sense, especially since cold boot appears to
work, so it sounds plausible that this may be timing-related.

Thanks for looking into this, it is definitely a strange problem.

Considering these drives don't support CDL anyway: Do you think it would
be possible to provide an "escape hatch" to disable only the CDL checks
(a module parameter?) so hotplug can work for the user again for their
device? If I see correctly, disabling just the CDL checks is not
possible (without recompiling the kernel) -- scsi_mod.dev_flags can be
used to disable RSOC, but I guess that has other unintended consequences
too, so a more "targeted" escape hatch would be nice.

Best,

Friedrich
