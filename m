I'm not sure what happened with dm-bow; I'll check with the person maintaining
it.

We expect that dm-default-key would be controversial, since it's sort of a
layering violation; metadata encryption really should be a filesystem-level
thing.  Satya has been investigating implementing it in filesystems instead.
I think we need to see how that turns out first.

The semantics expected by upper layers (e.g. filesystems) are that a "write" bio
that has an encryption context is equivalent to a "write" bio with no encryption
context that contains the data already encrypted.  Similarly, a "read" bio with
an encryption context is equivalent to submitting a "read" bio with no
encryption context, then decrypting the resulting data.

blk-crypto-fallback obviously works in that way.  However, when actual inline
encryption hardware is used, the encryption/decryption actually happens at the
lowest level in the stack.

To maintain the semantics in that case, the data can't be modified anywhere in
the stack.  For example, if the data also passes through a dm-crypt target that
encrypted/decrypted the data (again) in software, that would break things.

You're right that it's a bit more than that, though.  The targets also have to
behave the same way regardless of whether the data is already encrypted or not.
So if e.g. a target hashes the data, then it can't set
may_passthrough_inline_crypto, even if it doesn't change the data.  It can't
sometimes be hashing the plaintext data and sometimes the ciphertext data.
(And also, storing hashes of the plaintext on-disk would be insecure, as it
would leak information that encryption is meant to protect.)
