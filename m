For RPMB, we have converted them into char devices, thus
GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN is never set for them. The code needs a cleanup
to clarify this.

When it comes to eMMC boot partitions, those can be read/written to as
any other block device. Although, it's unlikely that they need
partitions as they are usually very small, 512Kb or 2MB in that
ballpark. At least, that was the thinking behind it when we added
GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN for them.

If you want to drop GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN for eMMC boot partitions, I
don't think it will be an issue.
