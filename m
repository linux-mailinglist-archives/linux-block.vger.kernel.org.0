The userspace implementation can be simplified a lot since generic
shared tag allocation isn't needed, meantime with good performance
(shared tags allocation in SMP is one hard problem)

The extension shouldn't be very hard, follows some raw ideas:

1) interface change

- add new feature flag of UBLK_F_SHARED_HOST, multiple ublk
  devices(ublkcXnY) are attached to the ublk host(ublkhX)

- dev_info.dev_id: in case of UBLK_F_SHARED_HOST, the top 16bit stores
  host id(X), and the bottom 16bit stores device id(Y)

- add two control commands: UBLK_CMD_ADD_HOST, UBLK_CMD_DEL_HOST

  Still sent to /dev/ublk-control

  ADD_HOST command will allocate one host device(char) with specified host
  id or allocated host id, tag_set is allocated as host resource. The
  host device(ublkhX) will become parent of all ublkcXn*

  Before sending DEL_HOST, all devices attached to this host have to
  be stopped & removed first, otherwise DEL_HOST won't succeed.

- keep other interfaces not changed
  in case of UBLK_F_SHARED_HOST, userspace has to set correct
  dev_info.dev_id.host_id, so ublk driver can associate device with
  specified host

2) implementation
- host device(ublkhX) becomes parent of all ublk char devices of
  ublkcXn*

- except for tagset, other per-host resource abstraction? Looks not
  necessary, anything is available in userspace

- host-wide error handling, maybe all devices attached to this host
  need to be recovered, so it should be done in userspace 

- per-host admin queue, looks not necessary, given host related
  management/control tasks are done in userspace directly

- others?


Thanks,
Ming
