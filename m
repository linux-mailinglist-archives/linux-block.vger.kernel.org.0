I happened to notice this patch is on the linux-dm/for-next branch
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=2137c0dcc04b24efb4c38d4b46b7194575718dd5)
and it has:

	Reported-by: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

This is wrong, I didn't report this.  I think you meant to put:

	Reported-by: Eric Wheeler <dm-devel@lists.ewheeler.net>
