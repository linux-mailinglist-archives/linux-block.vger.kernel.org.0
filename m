My interpretation was that kobject_del() (which is called in
mddev_delayed_delete() before the disk would be removed) removes the
mddev from the disk. At that point, it's just a structure hanging around
that will be freed when its last reference is dropped, which is the disk
itself cleaning up. I'm not sure how that would cause potential problems.
