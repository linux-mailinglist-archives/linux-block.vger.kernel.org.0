It looks this is the only area affected, but as you say, this should be
well documented (including comments in our own udev rules) so there are
no false assumptions made by other non-lvm/non-libdm users.

(I'm not counting the very corner use case of
'dmsetup --addnodeoncreate --verifyudev' which now ends up with a dev node
in /dev that logically returns -ENODEV when accessed instead of zero-sized
device as it was before.)
