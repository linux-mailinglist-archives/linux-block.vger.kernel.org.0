What text is changing?  The format of of the prefix of dev_*() is well
known and has been stable for 15+ years now, right?  What is difficult
in parsing it?

I don't expect that userspace should have to parse any human readable
portion, if they don't want to.  But if you do want it to, it is pretty
trivial to parse what you have today:

	scsi 2:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Generic  STORAGE DEVICE   1531 PQ: 0 ANSI: 6

If you really have a unique identifier, then great, parse it today:

	usb 4-1.3.1: Product: USB3.0 Card Reader
	usb 4-1.3.1: Manufacturer: Generic
	usb 4-1.3.1: SerialNumber: 000000001531

What's keeping that from working now?

In fact, I would argue that it does seem to work, as there are many
commercial tools out there that seem to handle it just fine...

Ok, messy stuff, don't do that :)

Great, you have a udev sysname, a kernel subsystem and a way to
associate that with a real device, what more are you wanting?

> Journald already knows how to utilize the dev_printk meta data.

And if you talk to the printk developers (which you seem to be keeping
out of the loop here), they are ripping out the meta data facility as
fast as possible.  So don't rely on extending that please.

I still fail to understand the root problem here.

Ok, no, I think I understand what you think the problem is, I just don't
see why it is up to the kernel to change what we have today when there
are lots of tools out there working just fine without any kernel changes
needed.

So try explaining the problem as you see it please, so we all know where
to work from.

But again, cutting out the developers of the subsystems you were wanting
to modify might just be making me really grumpy about this whole
thing...
