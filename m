When the deleted flag is set in del_gendisk(), it may not be observed
in time in bio_submit() because of memory/compiler re-order, so the
check is still sort of relax constraint. I guess the same is true for
read-only check.

Only blk_freeze_queue() includes the wait, and blk_freeze_queue_start()
doesn't.

RCU grace period is involved in blk_freeze_queue(). One way you can
avoid it is to keep the percpu ref at atomic mode when running
blk_mq_unfreeze_queue() in del_gendisk().
