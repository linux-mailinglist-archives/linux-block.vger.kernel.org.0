Does it need to add 3.3) here to explain when length of C is bigger than E
Or we can change 3.2 to cover these two conditions. In the codes, it splits
situation 3 into two parts.

The categorized situations are a little different with setting bad
block. Is it better
to use the same way as setting bad block? So we don't need to consider two
categorized ways to avoid switching them when reading codes.

If we only want to check if it starts after all badblocks, we can use
bad->start >= BB_END(p[prev]) directly. It's more easy to understand
than !overlap_front.

Can we move this check to overlap_front situation

If we move the check of table here, it should be
                    if (bb->count + 1 >= MAX_BADBLOCKS) {
                           len = sectors;
                           goto update_sectors;
                   }
Then it can do front_splitting_clear directly.

Can we do this like setting bad blocks? It can check behind overlap
after the loop?
So it can use the loop to handle the clearing bad block until the end of it.
