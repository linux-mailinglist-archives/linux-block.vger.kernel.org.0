While you or others did something approximating all that, really
doesn't mean it applicable here.

Please try to dial down the hyperbole and judgment. Ming wrote this
code. And you haven't been able to point out anything _actually_ wrong
with it (yet).

This patch's header does need editing for clarity, but we can help
improve it and the documentation above bio_rewind() in the code.

<insert tom-delonge-wtf.gif>

You see this bio_rewind() as history repeating itself, but it isn't
like what you ranted about in the past:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-block&m=153549921116441&w=2

I can certainly see why you think it similar at first glance. But this
patchset shows how bio_rewind() must be used, and how DM benefits from
using it safely (with no impact to struct bio or DM's per-bio-data).

bio_rewind() usage will be as niche as DM's use-case for it. If other
code respects the documented constraint, that the original bio's end
sector be preserved, then they can use it too.

The key is for a driver to maintain enough state to allow this fixed
end be effectively immutable. (DM happens to get this state "for free"
simply because it was already established for its IO accounting of
split bios).

The Linux codebase requires precision. This isn't new.

It isn't dangerous. It is an interface whose constraint needs to be
respected. Just like is documented for a myriad other kernel
interfaces.

Factoring out a bio_iter will bloat struct bio for functionality most
consumers don't need. And gating DM's ability to achieve this
patchset's functionality with some overdue refactoring is really _not_
acceptable.
