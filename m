Great!  That's exactly what I was looking for, thank you.

Bart, this is a perfect example of the potential race I've been talking 
about in the other email thread.  Suppose thread 0 is carrying out a 
runtime suspend of a SCSI disk and at the same time, thread 1 is opening 
the disk's block device (as we see in the stack trace here).  Then we 
could have the following:

	Thread 0		Thread 1
	--------		--------
	Start runtime suspend
	blk_pre_runtime_suspend calls
	  blk_set_pm_only and sets
	  q->rpm_status to RPM_SUSPENDING

				Call sd_open -> ... -> scsi_test_unit_ready
				  -> __scsi_execute -> ...
				  -> blk_queue_enter
				Sees BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT set and
				  RPM_SUSPENDING queue status, so does 
				  not postpone the request

	blk_post_runtime_suspend sets
	  q->rpm_status to RPM_SUSPENDED
	The drive goes into runtime suspend

				Issues the TEST UNIT READY request
				Request fails because the drive is suspended

One way to avoid this race is mutual exclusion: We could make sd_open 
prevent the drive from being runtime suspended until it returns.  
However I don't like this approach; it would mean tracking down every 
possible pathway to __scsi_execute and making sure that runtime suspend 
is blocked.

A more fine-grained approach would be to have __scsi_execute itself call 
scsi_autopm_get/put_device whenever the rq_flags argument doesn't 
contain RQF_PM.  This way we wouldn't have to worry about missing any 
possiible pathways.  But it relies on an implicit assumption that 
__scsi_execute is the only place where the PREEMPT flag gets set.

A third possibility is the approach I outlined before, adding a 
BLK_MQ_REQ_PM flag.  But to avoid the deadlock you pointed out, I would 
make blk_queue_enter smarter about whether to postpone a request.  The 
logic would go like this:

	If !blk_queue_pm_only:
		Allow
	If !BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT:
		Postpone
	If q->rpm_status is RPM_ACTIVE:
		Allow
	If !BLK_MQ_REQ_PM:
		Postpone
	If q->rpm_status is RPM_SUSPENDED:
		Postpone
	Else:
		Allow

The assumption here is that the PREEMPT flag is set whenever the PM flag 
is.

I believe either the second or third possibility would work.  The second 
looks to be the simplest

What do you think?
