Yes, there should be a fix for 07layouts in md-next already 
(92a2748dc3c5).

Your branch wasn't based off md-next and does have some conflicts. 

I've rebased your patches onto md-next, replaced patch 2 with 
my suggestion and ran my battery of tests on it and have found that 
it fixes the bug I identified and looks good to me.

https://github.com/sbates130272/linux-p2pmem   md-lifetime-fixes

This branch will still conflict (easily) with the patch
8b9ab62662 ("block: remove blk_cleanup_disk") in your branch.

How do you want to proceed with getting these merged?

Logan
