The data is interesting, and I guess the enable latency data could become
much less if 64 iodepth & 16 batch is used
    --iodepth=64 --iodepth_batch_submit=16 --iodepth_batch_complete_min=16

With 64 iodepth and submit/completion batching, I think NEED_GET_DATA
could become less.

Anyway, it is very helpful to share the test data, nice job!
