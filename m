I believe all bio's that bio_split() yields are supposed to be usable as-is
with the driver that created the queue limits. If the driver needs to split
further from there, I feel like that means the limits may need adjusting.

It sounds like max_hw_sectors is inconsistent with max_segments. Shouldn't this
work if max_hw_sectors was set to 'max_segments * logical_block_size'?

That's surprising. We use that in nvme where merges and splits to 4k segments
are required, but it works with larger page sizes.
