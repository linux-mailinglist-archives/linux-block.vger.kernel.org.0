LOOP_CHANGE_FD was introduced in 2.6.5 with the following changelog.

# 04/03/12	akpm@osdl.org	1.1608.83.42
# [PATCH] LOOP_CHANGE_FD ioctl
# 
# From: Arjan van de Ven <arjanv@redhat.com>
# 
# The patch below (written by Al Viro) solves a nasty chicken-and-egg issue
# for operating system installers (well at least anaconda but the problem
# domain is not exclusive to that)
# 
# The basic problem is this:
# 
# - The small first stage installer locates the image file of the second
#   stage installer (which has X and all the graphical stuff); this image can
#   be on the same CD, but it can come via NFS, http or ftp or ...  as well.
# 
# - The first stage installer loop-back mounts this image and gives control
#   to the second stage installer by calling some binary there.
# 
# - The graphical installer then asks the user all those questions and
#   starts installing packages.  Again the packages can come from the CD but
#   also from NFS or http or ...
# 
# Now in case of a CD install, once all requested packages from the first CD
# are installed, the installer wants to unmount and eject the CD and prompt
# the user to put CD 2 in.......  EXCEPT that the unmount can't work since
# the installer is actually running from a loopback mount of this cd.
# 
# The solution is a "LOOP_CHANGE_FD" ioctl, where basically the installer
# copies the image to the harddisk (which can only be done late since only
# late the target harddisk is mkfs'd) and then magically switches the backing
# store FD from underneath the loop device to the one on the target harddisk
# (and thus unbusying the CD mount).
# 
# This is obviously only allowed if the size of the new image is identical
# and if the loop image is read-only in the first place.  It's the
# responsibility of root to make sure the contents is the same (but that's of
# the give-root-enough-rope kind)

It is not clear why the size of old and new image files need to be the same.

It would be true that the size of old and new image files will not change
if these are stored in a read-only filesystem (e.g. isofs). But I think that
the size of new file (obtained by get_loop_size(lo, file)) and
the size of old file (obtained by get_loop_size(lo, old_file)) can change
via e.g. truncate() if these files are stored in a read-write filesystem.
Therefore,

	if (get_loop_size(lo, file) != get_loop_size(lo, old_file))
		goto out_err;

check in loop_change_fd() is racy. When we hit this race, nothing can prevent
LOOP_CHANGE_FD from succeeding, and I guess that nothing is broken by this race.
Can we kill this check (like a diff shown below)?

Also, does "the loop device is used read-only" check

        /* the loop device has to be read-only */
        error = -EINVAL;
        if (!(lo->lo_flags & LO_FLAGS_READ_ONLY))
                goto out_err;

make sense? If it is the responsibility of root to make sure that
the contents of the old and the new are the same, isn't it as well
the responsibility of root to use the loop device for read-only?
Unless there is a reason (i.e. we need this check in order to avoid
e.g. writeback failure, oops), can we also kill LO_FLAGS_READ_ONLY
check (like a diff shown below)?
