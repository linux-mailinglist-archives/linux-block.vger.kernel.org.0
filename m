Hi,

Thanks for using the NEED_GET_DATA feature.

Yes, with NEED_GET_DATA, you don't have to preallocate I/O buffers for WRITE requests.

We wait to allocate the buffer until we get UBLK_IO_RES_NEED_GET_DATA completion and submit again using UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA.  After we get the UBLK_IO_RES_OK completion from ublk, we submit the block request to the SPDK bdev layer.  After it completes, we submit using UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ and can free the I/O buffer because the data has been committed.

Yes, you are right.

But after the read operation is completed and SPDK submits the UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ, how do I know when ublk has finished copying data out of the buffer so that I can reuse that buffer?

In the WRITE path, data copy happens before the backend gets UBLK_IO_RES_OK.

In the READ path, data copy happens after the backend submits UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ,
but unfortunately we cannot know the time data copy happens because ublk driver does not notify
the backend until next request(on this tag) comes.

Zhang
