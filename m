And if the FS requires a power of 2 zone size, that will create fragmentation of
the zoned device support: some devices will be usable with an FS, others not.
Not nice at all. That is *not* something that exists today, for any block
device. I am not very keen on going down such route.

See above. Others (Keith, Christoph, Martin) may also have a different opinion.
