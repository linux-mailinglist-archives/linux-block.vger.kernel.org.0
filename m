Hi

I wouldn't use the busy state, as it does not take in-flight requests
into account.  For I/O control, the latter are as important as the
ones still queued in the scheduler.  For this reason, I take in-flight
requests into account when counting
bfqd->num_groups_with_pending_reqs.

See, e.g., this

	if (!bfqq->dispatched && !bfq_bfqq_busy(bfqq)) {
		...
		bfq_weights_tree_remove(bfqd, bfqq);
	}

in bfq_completed_request.

I would replicate the same logic in deciding whether the root group
has pending I/O.

First, let's see what you reply to my suggestion above.

Thanks,
Paolo
