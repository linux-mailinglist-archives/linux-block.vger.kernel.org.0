This year, the Maintainer's Summit will be held in Dublin on September
15th, 2022, just after the Linux Plumber's Conference (September
12-14).

As in previous years, the Maintainers Summit is invite-only, where the
primary focus will be process issues around Linux Kernel Development.
It will be limited to 30 invitees and a handful of sponsored
attendees.

Linus will be generating a core list of people to be invited to the
Maintainers Summit.  The top ten people from that list will receive
invites, and then program committee will use the rest of Linus's list
as a starting point of people to be considered.  People who suggest
topics that should be discussed at the Maintainers Summit will also
be added to the list for consideration.  To make topic suggestions for
the Maintainers Summit, please send e-mail to the
ksummit-discuss@lists.linuxfoundation.org list with a subject prefix
of [MAINTAINERS SUMMIT].

The Kernel Summit is organized as a track which is run in parallel
with the other tracks at the Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC), and is
open to all registered attendees of LPC.  The goal of the Kernel
Summit track will be to provide a forum to discuss specific technical
issues that would be easier to resolve in person than over e-mail.
The program committee will also consider "information sharing" topics
if they are clearly of interest to the wider development community
(i.e., advanced training in topics that would be useful to kernel
developers).

To suggest a topic for the Kernel Summit, please do two things. by
June 19th, 2022.  First, please tag your e-mail with [TECH TOPIC].  As
before, please use a separate e-mail for each topic, and send the
topic suggestions to the ksummit-discuss list.

Secondly, please create a topic at the Linux Plumbers Conference
proposal submission site and target it to the Kernel Summit track:

	https://lpc.events/event/16/abstracts/

Please do both steps.  I'll try to notice if someone forgets one or
the other, but your chances of making sure your proposal gets the
necessary attention and consideration are maximized by submitting both
to the mailing list and the web site.

If you were not subscribed on to the kernel-discuss mailing list from
last year (or if you had removed yourself after the kernel summit),
you can subscribe to the discuss list using mailman:

   https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/ksummit-discuss

The program committee this year is composed of the following people:

Greg KH
Jens Axboe
Ted Ts'o
Arnd Bergmann
Jon Corbet
