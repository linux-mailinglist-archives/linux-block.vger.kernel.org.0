I was suspicious that __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() would be still pulling
requests too aggressively from the IO scheduler (which effectively defeats
impact of cgroup IO weights on observed throughput). Now I did a few more
experiments with the workload doing multiple iterations for each kernel and
comparing ratios of achieved throughput when cgroup weights were in 2:1
ratio.

With this patch alone, I've got no significant distinction between IO from
two cgroups in 4 out of 5 test iterations. With your patch to update
max_dispatch in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() applied on top the results
were not significantly different (my previous test result was likely a
lucky chance). With my original patch to allocate driver tags early in
__blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() I get reliable distinction between cgroups -
the worst ratio from all the iterations is 1.4, average ratio is ~1.75.
This last result is btw very similar to ratios I can see when using
virtio-scsi instead of virtio-blk for the backing storage which is kind of
natural because virtio-scsi ends up using the dispatch-budget logic of SCSI
subsystem. I'm not saying my patch is the right way to do things but it
clearly shows that __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() is still too aggressive
pulling requests out of the IO scheduler.
