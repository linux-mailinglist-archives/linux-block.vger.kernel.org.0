IIUC, the sysfs node is needed to get better performance (by disabling
accounting)?
And splitting 1 and 2 above is also for better performance? If we add
the sysfs node,
I would prefer we use the same approach for all personalities (clone
in md.c). This
should simplify the code. If the user do not need extreme performance, we should
keep the stats on (default). If the user do need extreme performance, s/he could
disable stats via sysfs.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Song
