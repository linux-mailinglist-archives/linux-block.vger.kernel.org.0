So you submits 80M bytes from one CPU, and almost all these bios are completed
in single interrupt, which looks very impossible, except that your
UFS controller is far faster than the CPU.

scheduling response latency is system-wide too.

Then please document the interrupt latency improvement instead of
scheduling in your commit log, otherwise it is just misleading.

```
The CPU tick on a smartphone is only 4ms, which will undoubtedly affect
scheduling efficiency.
```
