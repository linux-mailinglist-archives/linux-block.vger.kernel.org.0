Actually, we do plan to use them. In RDMA and probably in DMA API also,
as I was suggested to provide general DMA map function, which will
perform mapping for array of phys_vecs.

Or introduce, it depends on the situation.

It is temporary, because we needed to use old SG interface. At some
point of time (after we will finish discussion/implementation of VFIO
and DMABUF), the blk_rq_map_*_sg() routines that are used for RDMA will 
be changed to do not use SG at all.

Yes, VFIO, DMABUF and RDMA are other places, so it is better to move
that struct phys_vec to general place now, so in next cycle we will
be able to reuse it.

It will print such stack if vec.len is more than u32, which is not
supposed to be.

It is not guarantee. If I understand it correctly, the guarantee comes
from upper layer which limits request size because of SG limitations.

I have no such strong feelings about cast here and can remove it.
