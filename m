You make it sound here like IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP would be some different type of
IO priority. For record it is not, there's just one IO priority per task,
if you set ioprio with IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP, it will just iterate all the tasks
in PGRP and set IO priority for each task. After my patches,
ioprio_get(IOPRIO_WHO_PGRPIO) will return the best of the effective IO
priorities of tasks within PGRP. Before my patch it was doing the same but
if IO priority was unset for some task it considered it to be CLASS_BE,4.

This is the same as above. Just the calls iterate over all tasks of the
given user...

I want to go back to returning IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE for tasks with unset IO
priority.

I also don't find (1) and (2) too important. (3) is IMHO somewhat important
and I think that the reason why nobody complained about the change there is
because your change is relatively new so it didn't propagate yet to any
widely used distro kernel...
