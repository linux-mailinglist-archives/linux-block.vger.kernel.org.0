I agree. However, let me just add some more information to this.

There are more partitions, like the RPMB for example. In regards to
partition switching, after serving a request to the RPMB partition, we
always switch back to the main user area. I think that is sufficient.

Also note that requests for the RPMB partitions are managed via
REQ_OP_DRV_IN|OUT.

You want to translate them to be managed similar to REQ_OP_DRV_IN|OUT, no?

I am just trying to understand what this would help us with, but I
don't get it, sorry.

I realize that I am joining the show a bit late, apologize for that.
But it seems like you are forgetting about re-tuning, urgent bkops,
card detect, SDIO combo cards, etc.

For example, re-tuning may be required because of a CRC error on the
previously sent transfer. Thus re-tuning must be done before serving
the next request.

Likewise, when the device signals urgent bkops status, we must not
serve any new request until the card has notified us that it is ready
with it's internal housekeeping operations.

Doing so, means re-tuning, bkops, etc, also needs to be managed in the
same way. Is this really the way to go?

Kind regards
