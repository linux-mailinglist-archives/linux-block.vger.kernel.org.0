That's quick. Thanks!

q->elevator is set from inside the I/O scheduler's init_sched callback 
and that callback is called with the request queue frozen. Freezing 
happens by calling blk_mq_freeze_queue() and that function waits until 
all previously submitted requests have finished. So I don't think that 
the race described above can happen.

Thanks,

Bart.
