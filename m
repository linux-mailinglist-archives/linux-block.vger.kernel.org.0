As suggested by Tejun, we can use percpu_ref_tryget(&blkg->refcnt) to 
make sure that we can only take a reference when the blkg is online. I 
think it is a bit safer to take a percpu refcnt to avoid use after free. 
My other concern about your patch is that the per cpu list iterations 
will be done multiple times when a blkcg is destroyed if many blkgs are 
attached to the blkcg. I still prefer to do it once in 
blkcg_destroy_blkgs(). I am going to post an updated version tomorrow 
after some more testings.

Cheers,
Longman
