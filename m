We're always open to that, provided that a promise is made to maintain
the in-kernel version. Sometimes we see submissions that end up being an
over-the-wall kind of dump, and then the vendor only maintains their own
out-of-tree version after the fact and point customers at that one too.
For those cases we don't want the driver, as it just becomes a
maintenance hassle for us.

So if you are serious about this, it's important to set and manage
internal expectations on how the driver is developed and maintained
going forward. The upstream driver *must* be the canonical version, and
if you want and need to have versions for older kernels available, then
it should be based on backports of the current in-tree driver.

Honestly I don't think that is that much work, and I wouldn't personally
be too worried about that being succesful. Complications are generally
mostly around APIs, since an in-tree driver might need to change how you
communicate with the driver. So yes, it'll be some work, but the
important part is how we treat the maintenance of it after all that is
said and done.

You have plenty of time to get this done before it becomes a problem.
It's not like the current patches are going to -stable.

I'm afraid not, we simply cannot allow exposing internals like that for
a use case that isn't currently covered by existing in-tree drivers.
