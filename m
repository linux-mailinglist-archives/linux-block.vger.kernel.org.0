Hello

Let me add some reasons why as primarily a support person that this is
important and try avoid another combative situation. 

Customers depend on managing device-mapper-multipath the way it is now
even with the advent of nvme-over-F/C. Years of administration and
management for multiple Enterprise O/S vendor customers (Suse/Red Hat,
Oracle) all depend on managing multipath access in a transparent way.

I respect everybody's point of view here but native does change log
alerting and recovery and that is what will take time for customers to
adopt. 

It is going to take time for Enterprise customers to transition so all
we want is an option for them. At some point they will move to native
but we always like to keep in step with upstream as much as possible.

Of course we could live with RHEL-only for while but that defeats our
intention to be as close to upstream as possible.

If we could have this accepted upstream for now perhaps when customers
are ready to move to native only we could phase this out.

Any technical reason why this would not fly is of course important to
consider but perhaps for now we have a parallel option until we dont.

With due respect to all concerned.

Laurence Oberman
