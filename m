Well, first thing is now you can't open a floppy with a write protected 
floppy installed. I don't think that was intended but that is now how it is.

Next there are commands that can be sent to the floppy via "ioctl(fd, 
FDRAWCMD,  &raw_cmd);" that do NOT require a floppy diskette to be 
installed.

All commands issued to the device that require a floppy diskette without 
a diskette installed fail with the proper status letting you know the 
device is not ready / no diskette installed. That goes for write 
protected floppies too.

There is no reason to force a user to only be able to operate on Linux 
fdformat formatted floppies.

Regards
Mark
