Not really. For now, it is using libata EH, that is, when we need the
internal command for the read log, we know the device is idle and no
command is on-going. So we send a non-NCQ command which does not have a tag.

Ideally, all of this should use a real reserved tag to allow for an NCQ
read log outside of EH, avoiding the drive queue drain.
