Maybe defect isn't one accurate word here.

I meant ->uring_cmd() is the only driver/fs callback in which
issue_flags is exposed, so IO_URING_F_UNLOCKED is visible to
driver, but io_ring_submit_lock() can't be done inside driver.

No such problem for direct io since the above io_uring details
isn't exposed to direct io code.
