I wonder if this makes a big difference; in the end, scheduler tags are 
primarily there to allow the scheduler to queue more requests, and 
potentially merge them. These tags are later converted into 'real' ones 
via blk_mq_get_driver_tag(), and only then the resource limitation takes 
hold.
Wouldn't it be sufficient to look at the number of outstanding commands 
per queue when getting a scheduler tag, and not having to implement yet 
another bitmap?

Cheers,

Hannes
