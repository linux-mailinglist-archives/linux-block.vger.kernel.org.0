Yes.

That would be set during device scan and device revalidate. And if the value
changes, then disk_set_zoned() should be called again to update the queue limit.
That is already what is done for the zoned limit indicating the type of the
drive. My point is that the zoned limit should dictate if use_zone_write_lock
can be true. The default should be be:

	q->limits.use_zone_write_lock = q->limits.zoned != BLK_ZONED_NONE.

And as proposed, if the UFS driver wants to disable zone write locking, all it
needs to do is call "disk_set_zoned(disk, BLK_ZONED_HM, false)". I did not try
to actually code that, and the scsi disk driver may be in the way and that may
need to be done there, hence the suggestion of having a use_zone_write_lock flag
in the scsi device structure so that the UFS driver can set it as needed as well
(and detect changes when revalidating). That should work, but I may be missing
something.

See above. The actual storage would still be in q->limits so that the block
layer can see it.

These DM targets do not support zoned devices, so I do not think it is an issue.

That said, you can still keep the parameter stacking, but at the very least, I
think it should be:

t->use_zone_write_lock = t->use_zone_write_lock || b->use_zone_write_lock;

so that for a target composed of multiple devices, if one needs zone write
locking, the DM device request that as well. Otherwise, problems may occur I think.
