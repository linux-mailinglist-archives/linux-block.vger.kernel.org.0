The same documentation also suggests that one can use inline comments:

In-line member documentation comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The structure members may also be documented in-line within the definition.
There are two styles, single-line comments where both the opening
``/**`` and
closing ``*/`` are on the same line, and multi-line comments where they
are each
on a line of their own, like all other kernel-doc comments::

  /**
   * struct foo - Brief description.
   * @foo: The Foo member.
   */
  struct foo {
        int foo;
        /**
         * @bar: The Bar member.
         */
...
