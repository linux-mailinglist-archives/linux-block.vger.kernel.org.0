Totally agree. We have more patches for simple copy, among others work
on F2FS that leverages for GC. We wanted to start with a simple patchset
enabling IOCTL to be an easy to review start. The rest of the patches
will come.

Makes sense.

Let us look into this. It makes sense.

It seems fair to start support bottom up from NVMe and then extend to
block layer and F2FS (potentially others). At this stage, we were
assuming that all the work that people like Martin, Bart and other have
been doing through the years on XCOPY could be integrated. Emulation can
be a part of this.

How can we move forward to do this in stages?
