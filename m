Subject: [PATCH v11 0/6] xenbus/backend: Add a memory pressure handler callback

Granting pages consumes backend system memory.  In systems configured
with insufficient spare memory for those pages, it can cause a memory
pressure situation.  However, finding the optimal amount of the spare
memory is challenging for large systems having dynamic resource
utilization patterns.  Also, such a static configuration might lack
flexibility.

To mitigate such problems, this patchset adds a memory reclaim callback
to 'xenbus_driver' (patch 1) and then introduce a lock for race
condition avoidance (patch 2).  Those two patches could be merged into
one patch if necessary.

The third patch applies the callback mechanism to mitigate the problem
in 'xen-blkback' (patch 3), but it lacks use of the race condition
mitigation.  Following change (patch 4) applies the race protection
mechanism to the blkback.  Patch 3 and patch 4 has seperated for only
review convenience.  Highly recommend to merge those into one patch as
patch 3 applied version might confuse bisecting.

The fifth and sixth patches are trivial cleanups; those fix nits we
found during the development of this patchset.

Note that patch 1, 3, 5, 6 are same with previous version.  I made the
changes in this version to different commits (only second and fourth
patches) to make review more comfortable.  Especially, the third and
fourth patches should be merged into one patch, as the third one alone
might make bisecting confuse.  Tthe next version of this patchset will
also merge those.


Base Version
