Firstly this way may waste lots of memory, especially the queue depth is
big, such as, hisilicon V3's queue depth is 4096.

Secondly, you have to deal with queue busy efficiently and correctly,
for example, your real hw tags(IPTT) can be used up easily, and how
will you handle these dispatched request?

Finally, you have to evaluate the performance effect, this is highly
related with how to deal with out-of-IPTT.

I'd suggest you to fix the stuff and post them out for review.

Thanks,
Ming
