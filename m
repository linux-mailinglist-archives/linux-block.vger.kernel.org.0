In general it looks like these changes were implemented very carefully
and are reasonable if we _really_ want to enable passing through inline
crypto.

I do have concerns about the inability to handle changes at runtime (due
to a table reload that introduces new devices without the encryption
settings the existing devices in the table are using).  But the fallback
mechanism saves it from being a complete non-starter.

Can you help me better understand the expected consumer of this code?
If you have something _real_ please be explicit.  It makes justifying
supporting niche code like this more tolerable.

Thanks,
Mike
