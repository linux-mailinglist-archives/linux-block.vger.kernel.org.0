Yes there is, but the contract we established for zoned devices in the block
layer, from the start of the support, is that users *must* write sequentially.
The block layer does not attempt, generally speaking, to reorder requests.

When mq-deadline is used, the scheduler lba reordering *may* reorder writes,
thus hiding potential bugs in the user write sequence for a zone. That is fine.
However, once a write request is dispatched, we should keep the assumption that
it is a well formed one, namely directed at the zone write pointer. So any
consideration of requeue solving write ordering issues is moot to me.

Furthermore, when the requeue happens, the target zone is still locked and the
only write request that can be in flight for that target zones is that one being
requeued. Add to that the above assumption that the request is the one we must
dispatch first, there are absolutely zero chances of seeing a reordering happen
for writes to a particular zone. I really do not see the point of requeuing that
request through the IO scheduler at all.

In general, even for reads, requeuing through the scheduler is I think a really
bad idea as that can potentially significantly increase the request latency
(time to completion), with the user seeing long tail latencies. E.g. if the
request has high priority or a short CDL time limit, requeuing through the
scheduler will go against the user indicated urgency for that request and
degrade the effectivness of latency control easures such as IO priority and CDL.

Requeues should be at the head of the dispatch queue, not through the scheduler.

As long as we keep zone write locking for zoned devices, requeue to the head of
the dispatch queue is fine. But maybe this work is preparatory to removing zone
write locking ? If that is the case, I would like to see that as well to get the
big picture. Otherwise, the latency concerns I raised above are in my opinion, a
blocker for this change.
