Hi Jens and James,

This is what I found in the HPB 2.0 specification (the spec is
copyrighted but I assume that I have the right to quote small parts of
that spec):

<quote>
6.3 HPB WRITE BUFFER Command

HPB WRITE BUFFER command have following 3 different function depending
on the value of BUFFER_ID field.
1) Inactivating an HPB Region (supported in host control mode only)
2) prefetching HPB Entries from the host to the device (supported in any
    control mode)
3) Inactivating all HPB Regions, except for Provisioning Pinned Region
    in the host (supported in device control mode only)
</quote>

Reverting only the problematic code (HPB 2.0) sounds reasonable to me
because reworking the HPB 2.0 code will be nontrivial. Using
BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING might be a viable approach. However, I don't want to
see that flag enabled in the UFS driver if HPB is not used because of
the negative performance effects of that flag.

Thanks,

Bart.
