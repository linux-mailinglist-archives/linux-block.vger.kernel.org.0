I'm still a bit confused :( I do understand that in the above case that
IO size < max_sectors, raid5 can handle it and there is not much
difference, what I don't understand is why not aligned to io_opt, for
example, in the above case if I increase io size to 448 *n, I would
expect the result as following:(assume max_sectors = 1M)

4 + 444, 448 + 448*2, 448*3 + 448*2, ..., 448*n + 4;

Other than the head and tail, all splited bio in the middle will end up
with full stripes.

And in this patch, becasue do_div can pass, then splited bio will end up
like:

4 + 448*2, 4+448*2 + 448*2, ...

And each bio will not end up with full stripes, I don't get it how this
behaviour have any difference without this patch, raid5 will have to try
fill in stripes with different bio.

Thanks,
Kuai
