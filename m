Try multiplying that by 100... 28TB SMR drives have 104000 zones.

That is far from guaranteed, especially with devices that have no active zone
limits like SMR drives.

May be. The performance numbers I have suggest that this is not an issue.

But in any case, what exactly is your idea here ? Can you actually suggest
something ? Are you suggesting that a sparse array of zone plugs be used, with
an rb-tree or an xarray ? If that is what you are thinking, I can already tell
you that this is the first thing I tried to do. Early versions of this work used
a sparse xarray of zone plugs. But the problem with such approach is that it is
a lot more complicated and there is a need for a single lock to manage that
structure (which is really not good for performance).

Hence this series which used a statically allocated array of zone plugs to
simplify things. Overall, this series is a significant change to the zone write
path and I wanted something simple/reliable that is not a nightmare to debug and
test. I believe that an xarray based optimization can be re-tried as an
incremental change on top of this series. The nice thing about it is that the
API should not need to change, meaning that all changes can be contained within
blk-zone.c.

But I may be missing entirely your point. So clarify please.
