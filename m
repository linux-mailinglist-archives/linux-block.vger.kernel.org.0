What BFQ is doing is fine, IFF it always ensures that the queue is run
at some later time, if it returns "yep I have work" yet returns NULL
when attempting to retrieve that work. Generally this should happen from
subsequent IO completion, or whatever else condition will resolve the
issue that is currently preventing dispatch of that request. Last resort
would be a timer, but that can happen if you're slicing your scheduling
somehow.

You're comparing apples to oranges, CFQ never worked within the blk-mq
scheduling framework.

That said, I don't think such a change is needed. If we currently have a
hang due to this discrepancy between has_work and gets_work, then it
sounds like we're not always re-running the queue as we should. From the
original patch, the budget putting is not something the scheduler is
involved with. Do we just need to ensure that if we put budget without
having dispatched a request, we need to kick off dispatching again?
