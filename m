On top of that, what if signals were sent for other reasons than just
terminate it? Flushing a fatal signal from "some task" seems bad enough
on its own, but we could be losing others as well.

Coly, this seems like a very bad idea. And the same goes for the
existing flush_signals() in bcache. It's just not the right way to deal
with it, and it could be causing other issues.
