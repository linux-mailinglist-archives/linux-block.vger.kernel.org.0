Sorry I missed this earlier.

I don't have an X15 with me here but I'm trying to set one up in our
remote farm. In the meantime, I tried to reproduce this issue on two
platforms (dra72-evm and am57xx-evm) and wasn't able to see the issue
because those eMMC's don't even have a cache. I will keep you updated
when I do get a board with a eMMC that has a cache.

Is there a way to reproduce this CMD6 issue with another operation?

Thanks,
Faiz
