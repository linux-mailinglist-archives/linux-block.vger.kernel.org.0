Yes, it was one trouble because ublk server can do whatever.

However, since your task_registered_buffers optimization, ublk request
won't be completed from freeing uring_ctx context any more, and it is always
aborted from ublk_abort_queue(), so it is failed in case of killed ublk
server.

The situation can be improved by failing request explicitly by setting io->res
as -EIO, then -EIO can be taken first in case of killed ublk server.

The reference is initialized as UBLK_REFCOUNT_INIT, the only way for
triggering it is to make the counter overflow first.

Yes, overflow can be detected & warned by refcount checking, also it is only
allowed for privileged user, so looks this way is just fine.
