The allocation of the pool of free pages involves more than get_page,
it uses gnttab_alloc_pages which in the worse case will allocate a
page and balloon it out issuing one hypercall.

Right, my main concern is that we seem to be adding duck tape so
things don't fall apart, but if such cache is really not beneficial
from a performance PoV I would rather see it go away than adding more
stuff to it in order to workaround corner cases like memory
starvation.

Anyway, I guess we can take such change, but long term we need to look
into fixing grants to not use ballooned pages, and figure out if the
blkback free page cache is really useful or not.

Thanks, Roger.
