It would be still nice to know where this is coming from.

ok, fine. Thanks for testing.

So I guess that this is a regression, and you would want this series for 
v5.16, right? My changes were made with v5.17 in mind.

I am not sure how Jens feels about it, since the changes are 
significant. It would be a lot easier to argue for v5.16 if we got to 
this point earlier in the cycle...

Anyway, it would be good to have full review first, so please help with 
that.

@Ming, can you please give feedback on 3/3 here?

BTW, I am on vacation next week and can't help progress then, so any 
assistance would be good.

Thanks,
John
