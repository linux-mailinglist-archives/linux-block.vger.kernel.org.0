You definitely do need poll queue sharing to hit this.

By "failed to submit" I mean that req->result == -EAGAIN. We set that in
io_complete_rw_iopoll(), which is called off bio_wouldblock_error() in
the block layer. This is different from an ret != 0 return, which would
have been some sort of other failure we encountered, failing to submit
the request. For that error, we just end the request. For the
bio_wouldblock_error(), we need to retry submission.

Right, if ret != 0, then we have a fatal error for that request.
->result will not have been set at all for that case.

Always, since it happens inline from when you attempt to issue the read.

Sure, we're not disabling preemption. But that shouldn't have any
bearing on this case.

Exactly

The ring/context isn't mapped to a particular ring, a specific IO is
mapped to a specific queue at the time it's being submitted. That
depends on the IO type and where that task happens to be running at the
time the IO is being submitted.
