The problem here would be that "before issuing the next write" needs to be
really before we do a blk_queue_enter() for that write, so that would need to be
on entry to blk_mq_submit_bio() or before in the stack. Otherwise, we endup with
the write bio completing depending on the report zones, again, and the potential
hang is back.

But I have something now that completely remove report zones. Same idea as you
suggested: a BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag that is set on error and an
automatic update of the zone write plug to the start sector of a bio when we
start seeing writes again for that zone. The idea is that well-behaved users
will do a report zone after a failed write and restart writing at the correct
position.

And for good measures, I modified report zones to also automatically update the
wp of zones that have BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE. So the user doing a report
zones clears everything up.

Overall, that removes *a lot* of code and makes things a lot simpler. Starting
test runs with that now.
