Hi Gabriel,
     There is a project implement userspace block device: 
https://github.com/ubbd/ubbd

ubbd means Userspace Backend Block Device (as ubd was taken by UML block 
device.)

It has a kernel module ubbd.ko, userspace daemon ubbdd, and a tool ubbdadm.
(1) ubbd.ko depends on uio, providing cmd ring and complete ring.
(2) ubbdd implement different backends, currently file and rbd is done.
and ubbdd is designed for online restart. That means you can restart 
ubbdd with IO inflight.
(3) ubbdadm is an admin tool, providing map, unmap and config.

This project is under developing stage, but it is already tested by 
blktests and xfstests.

Also, there is some testing for rbd backend to compare performance with 
librbd and krbd.

You can find more information about it in github, if you are interested 
in it.

Thanx
