It's true and it introduced many lock dependency problems before.
We actually had the lock in the rw path but we removed the lock
so without strong reason, I'd like to avoid the lock in the rw path.

    zram: remove init_lock in zram_make_request

    Admin could reset zram during I/O operation going on so we have used
    zram->init_lock as read-side lock in I/O path to prevent sudden zram
    meta freeing.

    However, the init_lock is really troublesome.  We can't do call
    zram_meta_alloc under init_lock due to lockdep splat because
    zram_rw_page is one of the function under reclaim path and hold it as
    read_lock while other places in process context hold it as write_lock.
    So, we have used allocation out of the lock to avoid lockdep warn but
    it's not good for readability and fainally, I met another lockdep splat
    between init_lock and cpu_hotplug from kmem_cache_destroy during working
    zsmalloc compaction.  :(

    Yes, the ideal is to remove horrible init_lock of zram in rw path.  This
    patch removes it in rw path and instead, add atomic refcount for meta
    lifetime management and completion to free meta in process context.
    It's important to free meta in process context because some of resource
    destruction needs mutex lock, which could be held if we releases the
    resource in reclaim context so it's deadlock, again.

    As a bonus, we could remove init_done check in rw path because
    zram_meta_get will do a role for it, instead.
