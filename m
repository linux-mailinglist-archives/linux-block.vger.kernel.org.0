This series also doesn't actually remove the data_unit_size bvec alignment
requirement from block/blk-crypto.c.  Isn't that the main goal here?  So I
expected that it would be included.

Unless there are special considerations here, I'd expect that all the block
layer changes needed for the fscrypt direct I/O support would be in one patch
series that could go in together, and then the patch series with the direct I/O
support would be only filesystem layer changes.
