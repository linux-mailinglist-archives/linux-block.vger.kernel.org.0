OK, maybe I misunderstood your point.

No matter 14 or 17, it does sync with REQ_OP_ZONE_*, even though it
isn't necessary to do so.

Then your all comment on this patch should be addressed, right?

I don't think it is necessary, see below.

(5, 10) can be reserved for some more generic normal IOs, maybe new kind
of READ/WRITE, or whatever.

We have 256 OP available, which is big enough for future extend, and OP
code can be used from any offset, but still more readable to group them
according to their category. And it isn't big deal to use which number
for which command, what matters is that we can extend, and keep
compatible.


Thanks,
