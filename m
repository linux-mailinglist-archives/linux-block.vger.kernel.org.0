No, I didn't change how that's handled. Also AFAICS the kernel does not add
PID information to BLK_TN_MESSAGE events (which is how bfq log messages are
passed) so blkparse has nothing to display even if it wanted.

So poor man's solution is to derive pid from the BFQ queue name and then
lookup process name from some other event. Nicer solution would be to
modify blktrace handling in the kernel to add PID information to such
events as well so we get similar info as when using tracing infrastructure
directly.
