I'd suggest you to share more details about this use case first:

1) what is the in-kernel network boot infrastructure? which functions
does it provide for user?

2) how does the in kernel QCOW2 interacts with in-kernel network boot
infrastructure?

3) most important thing, what are the exact steps for one user to use
the in-kernel network boot infrastructure and in-kernel QCOW2?

Without knowing the motivation/purpose and exact use case, it doesn't
make sense to discuss the implementation details, IMO.

Thanks,
Ming
