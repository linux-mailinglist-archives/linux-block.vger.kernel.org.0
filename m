I can say "hey, I have this policy that the person who triggered an
event needs such-and-such permission, otherwise the event gets
suppressed".  But this isn't a full use case, and it's buggy.  It's
not a full use case because I haven't specified what my actual goal is
and why this particular policy achieves my goals.  And it's entirely
full of bugs because, as this patch so nicely illustrates, it's not
well defined who triggered the event.  For example, if I exec a setuid
process, who triggers the close?  What if I send the fd to systemd
over a socket and immediately close my copy before systemd gets (and
ignores) the message?  Or if I send it to Wayland, or to any other
process?

A file is closed when everyone is done with it.  Trying to figure out
who the last intentional user of the file was seems little better than
random guessing.  Defining a security policy based on it seems like a
poor idea.

Casey, I think you need to state your requirement in a way that's well
defined, and I think you need to make a compelling case that your
requirement is indeed worth dictating the design of parts of the
kernel outside LSM.
