I took a closer look at the zone write plug reference handling, and it
still doesn't look very good. Why are some just atomic_dec and there's
just one spot that does dec_and_test? This again looks like janky
referencing, to be honest.

The relationship seems like it should be pretty clear. Any bio inflight
against this zone plug should have a reference to it, AND the owner
should have a reference to it, otherwise any bio completion (which can
happen at ANY time) could free it. Any dropping of the ref should use a
helper that does atomic_dec_and_test(), eg what disk_put_zone_wplug()
does.

There should be no doubt about the above at all. If the plug has been
added to a workqueue, it should be quite obvious that of course it has a
reference to it already, outside of the bio's that are in it.

I'd strongly encourage getting this sorted out before the merge window,
I'm not at all convinced it's correct as-is. It's certainly not
obviously correct, which it should be. The RCU rules are pretty simple
if the the references are done in the kernel idiomatic way, but they are
not.
