Hi,

First of all, there are two conditions to trigger the problem in bfq:
a. issuing sync IO concurrently. (I was testing in one cgroup, and
I think multiple cgroups is the same.)
b. not issuing in root cgroup.

The phenomenon is that the performance will degradated to single
process. The reason is that bfq_queue will never expired untill
BUDGET_TIMEOUT since num_groups_with_pending_reqs will always be
nonzero after issuing io to driver, which means that there is only
one request in progress(during D2C) at any given moment.

I was trying to skip the checking of active group if bfq.weight is not
changed, and it's implemented by adding a varible 'check_active_group',
it'll only set to true if bfq.weight is changed.

This approach will work fine is the weight stay unchanged, and will
not be effective if the weight ever changed. This is why I said it's
a circumvention plan.

By the way, while testing with cfq, I found that the current active cfq
queue can be preempted in such special case. I wonder if it's worth
referring to bfq.

Thanks,
Yu Kuai
