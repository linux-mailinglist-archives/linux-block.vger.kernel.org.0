Not sure if that happens here, but makes sense.

Yes, but that isn't what is calculated. What is calculated is
         mask - offset + 1
where
         offset = mask & (page_to_phys(start_page) + offset);

with mask == 0xffffffff, offset == 0, we get:
         mask - offset + 1 = 0xffffffff - 0 + 1 = 0x100000000, which is > 4G.
