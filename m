DM core does the splitting for VDO (just like any other DM target).
In 5.9 I updated DM to use chunk_sectors, use blk_stack_limits()
stacking of it, and also use blk_max_size_offset().

But all that block core code has shown itself to be too rigid for DM.  I
tried to force the issue by stacking DM targets' ti->max_io_len with
chunk_sectors.  But really I'd need to be able to pass in the per-target
max_io_len to blk_max_size_offset() to salvage using it.

Stacking chunk_sectors seems ill-conceived.  One size-fits-all splitting
is too rigid.

Again, DM does its own splitting... that aspect of it isn't an issue.
The problem is the basis for splitting cannot be the stacked up
chunk_sectors.
