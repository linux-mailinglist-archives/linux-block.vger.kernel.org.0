There is only one blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queues(BLK_MQ_BUDGET_DELAY) in
__blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() with 3ms delay, so in theory there will be at most
(300 * nr_hw_queues) calls/s, but nr_hw_queues could be big as nr_cpus.

Yeah, it is one BFQ specific behavior, and BFQ just said there is work
to do, but it can't be dispatched immediately.

You may refer to commit a0823421a4d7("blk-mq: Rerun dispatching in the case of
budget contention")

BTW, I think the approach in your patch is good enough for handling the
issue. For BFQ and mq-deadline, it is enough to just run one hctx in
blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queues() and blk_mq_run_hw_queues().
