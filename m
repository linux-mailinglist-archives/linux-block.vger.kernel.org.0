I said so in the context that if lifetime is a per-inode property, then ioprio
is the wrong interface since the ioprio API is per process or per IO. There is a
mismatch.

One version of your patch series used fnctl() to set the lifetime per inoe,
which is fine, and then used the BIO ioprio to pass the lifetime down to the
device driver. That is in theory a nice trick, but that creates conflicts with
the userspace ioprio API if the user uses that at the same time.

So may be we should change bio ioprio from int to u16 and use the freedup u16
for lifetime. With that, things are cleanly separated without growing struct bio.

When the struct is randomized, holes move or disappear. Don't count on that...
