Thanks, I got your point, I will test the impact on raid0 aggregated 
disks and will report the numbers with this proposed patch. During my 
debugging I actually tried to iterate the list from head to tail looking 
for the perfect request to merge and although that improved the bio 
merge success rate, it actually dropped the fio randwrite B.W by about 
66% compared to the baseline performance without reverting e70c301faece 
("block: don't reorder requests in blk_add_rq_to_plug") and that's 
likely because of the overhead of iterating the whole plug list to look 
for the perfect request to merge with.

I think this should be break? it's not clear to me why would you need to 
continue scanning the list if blk_try_merge() returns ELEVATOR_NO_MERGE 
here?
