I think if we're going to do that as a topic (and I'm not opposed!),
we need data.  Various workloads, various block sizes, etc.  Right now
people discuss this topic with "feelings" and "intuition" and I think
we need more than vibes to have a productive discussion.

My laptop (rebooted last night due to an unfortunate upgrade that left
anything accessing the sound device hanging ...):

MemTotal:       16006344 kB
MemFree:         2353108 kB
Cached:          7957552 kB
AnonPages:       4271088 kB
Slab:             654896 kB

so ~50% of my 16GB of memory is in the page cache and ~25% is anon memory.
If the page cache is all in 16kB chunks and we need to allocate order-2
folios in order to read from a file, we can find it easily by reclaiming
other order-2 folios from the page cache.  We don't need to resort to
heroics like eliminating use of alloc_page().

We should eliminate use of alloc_page() across most of the kernel, but
that's a different topic and one that has not much relevance to LSF/MM
since it's drivers that need to change, not the MM ;-)

Now, other people "feel" differently.  And that's cool, but we're not
going to have a productive discussion without data that shows whose
feelings represent reality and for which kinds of workloads.
