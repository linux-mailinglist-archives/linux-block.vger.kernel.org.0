Agree.

The limit is actually originated from current implementation, both
REGISTER_IO_BUF and UNREGISTER_IO_BUF should be fine to run from other
pthread because the request buffer 'meta' is actually read-only.

BLK_MQ_F_TAG_RR can be set for this way, so is it possible to make this
as one feature? And set BLK_MQ_F_TAG_RR for this feature.

Also can you share what the preferred implementation is for ublk server?

I think per-io pthread may not be good, maybe partition tags space into
fixed range/pthread?

`ublk_queue' reference is basically read-only in IO code path, I think
it need to be declared explicitly as 'const' pointer in IO code/uring code
path first. Otherwise, it is easy to trigger data race with per-io task
since it is lockless.
