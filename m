Ah. Misread stuff. You're excluding the REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT here.
But then it's _actually_ similar to the next patch (which I've also
commented).

Wouldn't it be better to fold them into one patch and discuss things
together; especially as my comment to the next one might actually
achieve the same thing?

Cheers,
