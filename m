[Top-posting to provide general update and historic context]

Hi all,

Corwin has decided to leave Red Hat, I want to thank Corwin for his
efforts in developing and/or leading the development of changes to the
VDO codebase (including those that were a prereq for VDO's upstream
submission).

Matt Sakai (cc'd) and I will be meeting regularly to continue the work
of driving VDO changes needed for the code to be what I consider
"ready" for upstream Linux inclusion.  Matt has a lot of learning to
do about Linux kernel development (most of his work was in userspace
since VDO can be compiled and used in userspace).  Conversely, I
still have much to learn about the VDO codebase.  Hopefully we get
over our respective learning curves quicker by working together.

My following email is nearly 6 years old and reflects the list of
VDO changes initially determined to be needed soon after Red Hat
acquired Permabit:

The bulk of the above list (and more that wasn't on it) has been
resolved.  It took ~6 years because corwin and the VDO team were also
supporting the VDO in production, with historic and new customers,
while also working on incrementally addressing the above list (and
more).

But the long-standing dependency on VDO's work-queue data
struct is still lingering (drivers/md/dm-vdo/work-queue.c). At a
minimum we need to work toward pinning down _exactly_ why that is, and
I think the best way to answer that is by simply converting the VDO
code over to using Linux's workqueues.  If doing so causes serious
inherent performance (or functionality) loss then we need to
understand why -- and fix Linux's workqueue code accordingly. (I've
cc'd Tejun so he is aware).

Also, VDO's historic use of murmurhash3 predates there being any
alternative hash that met their requirements.  There was discussion of
valid alternatives briefly, see:
https://listman.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2023-May/054267.html
So improving the interface so that the chosen hash is selectable
(while still allowing murmurhash3 to be selected for backward compat)
would be ideal.

Lastly, one of the most challenging problems that VDO currently has
is: discard performance is very slow.  VDO isn't a fast target in
general (born out of its need for 4K IO to achieve best dedup results)
but the discard support is a well-known VDO pain-point that I need to
understand more clearly.

I'm sure there will be other things that elevate to needing further
review and scrutiny.  This will _not_ be a _quick_ process.

But I've always wanted the VDO team to be extremely successful and
look forward to working closer with them on trying to prepare VDO for
upstream inclusion so it can stick the landing.

All said, I really would welcome review for others on the dm-devel and
linux-block mailing list.  I'll take any and all technical concerns
under advisement and work through them.

Thanks,
Mike
