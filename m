Sorry I was wrong here. Indeed interrupts are disabled for IO queues in 
polling mode. Then this can be a problem.

If CPU migration happens, separate split bios can be enqueued into 
different polling hardware queues (e.g. queue 1

and queue 2). The caller is continuously polling on one of the polling 
hardware queue (e.g. queue 1) indicated by the

returned cookie. If there's no other thread polling on the other 
hardware queue (e.g. queue 2), the split bio on queue 2

will not be reaped since the interrupt of queue 2 is disabled. Finally 
the completion of this bio (on queue 2) relies on

timeout mechanism.

Same issue described above.
