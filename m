It will work, but, to be consistent with lvm, I suggest to overwrite the=20
first 4k with zeroes.

This is hard to say, it depends on what the user is doing with the phone.=
=20
When dm-snapshot runs out of space, it invalidates the whole snapshot.=20
You'll have to monitor the snapshot space very carefully and take action=20
before it fills up.

I suggest - run main system on the origin target and attach a snapshot=20
that will be used for backup of the data overwritten in the origin. If the=
=20
updated system fails, merge the snapshot back into the origin; if the=20
update succeeds, drop the snapshot. If the user writes too much data to=20
the device, it would invalidate the only the snapshot (so he can't revert=
=20
anymore), but it would not invalidate the origin and the data would not be=
=20
lost.

Yes, we don't plan to change it.

I don't know. What is the block size of the filesystem? Are all mappings=20
aligned to this block size?
