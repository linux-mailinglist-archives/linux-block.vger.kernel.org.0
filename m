No, it is. As the description says, the flag not only indicates that there are
plugged BIOs, but it also indicates that there is a write for the zone
in-flight. And that can happen even with the BIO list being empty. E.g. for a
qd=1 workload of small BIOs, no BIO will ever be added to the BIO list, but the
zone still must be marked as "plugged" when a write BIO is issued for it.

Hannes also commented about this. Let me revisit this.

This patch modifies blk_mq_submit_bio() to add a "goto new_request" at the top
for any BIO flagged with BIO_FLAG_ZONE_WRITE_PLUGGING. So when a plugged BIO is
unplugged and submitted again, the reference that was taken in
blk_zone_wplug_add_bio() is reused for the new request for that BIO.
