I meant the issue can be reproduced on kernel before 5b18b5a73760("block:
delete part_round_stats and switch to less precise counting").

Also do we really need to fix this issue? I understand device
utilization becomes not accurate at very small load, is it really
worth of adding runtime load in fast path for fixing this issue?

No, I just saw report on Azure NVMe.

Please see the following case:

1) one device has 256 hw queues, and the system has 256 cpu cores, and
each hw queue's depth is 1k.

2) there isn't any io load on CPUs(0 ~ 254)

3) heavy io load is run on CPU 255

So with your trick the code still need to iterate hw queues from 0 to 254, and
the load isn't something which can be ignored. Especially it is just for
io accounting.


Thanks,
Ming
