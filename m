Christ indeed.

But I think you meant "Chris".

Hmm. I have clang-15 too, but I do the allmodconfig builds with gcc,
and only my own "normal config" builds with clang.

So I don't see this particular issue and my builds are still squeaky clean.

That said, when I explicitly try that allmodconfig thing with clang, I
can see it too. And the reason seems to be something we've seen
before: UBSAN functions being considered non-return by clang, so clang
generates code like this:

   ....
.LBB24_3:
        callq   __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc@PLT
        movl    $2, %esi
        movq    $.L__unnamed_3, %rdi
        callq   __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds
.Lfunc_end24:
        .size   m5mols_set_fmt, .Lfunc_end24-m5mols_set_fmt

ie the last thing in that m5mols_set_fmt() function is a call to
__ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds, and then it "falls through" to the next
function.

And yes, I absolutely *detest* how clang does that. Not only does it
cause objtool sanity checking issues, it fundamentally means that we
can never treat UBSAN warnings as warnings. They are always fatal.

This is a *huge* clang mis-feature, and I forget what we decided last
that we saw it.

But I suspect we need to disable UBSAN for clang, because clang gets
this so *horribly* wrong.

Fatal errors that cannot be recovered from are not something that the
compiler is supposed to decide on. It's exactly the same issue as
BUG() calls: it just results in a dead machine, and in the process the
actual problem easily gets lost (because maybe this only happens while
running X, and no serial console, and no way to actually see what the
UBSAN warning was as a result).

I really really detest this thing, and I think this is a fatal flaw,
and means that as-is, UBSAN really *has* to be disabled for clang
kernel builds. Maybe that will make somebody wake up and smell the
roses, and stop this idiotic "undefined behavior is fatal" garbage.

Nick? Do you remember what the fix was last time?
