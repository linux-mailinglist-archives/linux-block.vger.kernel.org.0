Exactly. What applications ? For ZNS, I cannot say as devices have not
been available for long. But neither can you.

> Why would that break those ZNS applications?

Please keep in mind that there are power of 2 zone sized ZNS devices out
there. Applications designed for these devices and optimized to do bit
shift arithmetic using the power of 2 size property will break. What the
plan for that case ? How will you address these users complaints ?

Which is really an ugly approach. The kernel zone user interface is
common to all zoned devices: SMR, ZNS, null_blk, DM (dm-crypt,
dm-linear). They all have one point in common: zone size is a power of
2. Zone capacity may differ, but hey, we also unified that by reporting
a zone capacity for *ALL* of them.

Applications correctly designed for SMR can thus also run on ZNS too.
With this in mind, the spectrum of applications that would break on non
power of 2 ZNS devices is suddenly much larger.

This has always been my concern from the start: allowing non power of 2
zone size fragments userspace support and has the potential to
complicate things for application developers.

Please do not bring in corporate strategy aspects in this discussion.
This is a technical discussion and I am not talking as a representative
of my employer nor should we ever dicsuss business plans on a public
mailing list. I am a kernel developer and maintainer. Keep it technical
please.
