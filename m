Right, I agree!

Note 1) Reliable write was introduced way before cache management in
the eMMC spec. So, if the support for reliable write would have a
stricter implementation than needed, I would not be surprised.

Note 2) In the eMMC v5.1 spec, the cache flushing support has been
extended to allow an explicit barrier operation. Perhaps, we should
let that option take precedence over a regular flush+barrier, for
REQ_OP_FLUSH!?

That's the tricky part to know, as it's the internals of the eMMC.

Although, it seems like both Avri (WDC) and Bean (Micron) would be
happy to proceed with $subject patch, which makes me more comfortable
to move forward.

That would be great, thanks a lot for helping out with testing!

Kind regards
