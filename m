No. It's a good catch, but bug looks specific to the folio work to me.

Almost all shmem pages are dirty from birth, even as soon as they are
brought back from swap; so it is not necessary to re-mark them dirty.

The exceptions are pages allocated to holes when faulted: so you did
get me worried as to whether khugepaged could collapse a pmd-ful of
those into a THP without marking the result as dirty.

But no, in v6.5-rc6 the collapse_file() success path has
	if (is_shmem)
		folio_mark_dirty(folio);
and in v5.10 the same appears as
		if (is_shmem)
			set_page_dirty(new_page);

(IIRC, that or marking pmd dirty was missed from early shmem THP
support, but fairly soon corrected, and backported to stable then.
I have a faint memory of versions which assembled pmd_dirty from
collected pte_dirtys.)

And the !is_shmem case is for CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS: writing
into those pages, by direct IO or whatever, is already prohibited.

It's dem dirty (or not dirty) folios dat's the trouble!
