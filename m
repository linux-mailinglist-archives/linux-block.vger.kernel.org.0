Mikulas touches on why why using errno isn't useful for DM. And for
DM's device stacking it is hard to know which error spewed to dmesg
(via DMERR, DMCRIT, DMINFO, etc) is relevant to a particular admin
interface issuing the DM ioctl.

So the idea to send the (hopefully useful) error string back up to the
relevant userspace consumer was one task that seemed needed (based on
Milan Broz's various complaints against DM.. which sprang from your
regular remainder that DM's version numbers are broken and need to be
removed/replaced).

Making DM errors more useful to the endpoints causing them was dealt
with head-on with a couple small changes in this pull request. I
didn't think sending useful error strings to userspace was such a
contested design point.

All said, we'll have a look at dealing with your suggested fsconfig
unification (but it seems really awkward on the surface, maybe we can
at least distill out some subset that is common).

Mike
