I'm sure there is something very wrong somewhere, and that it's not BFQ's
fault. I just haven't been able to pinpoint the problem.

I ended up finding an H700 card with cables that should fit, so I'm going to
try this first, and see what happens, thanks o1bigtenor for the suggestion.

Linux-raid folks, the original post still has a warning likely worth looking
into:
[14852.341924] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2530 at drivers/md/md.c:8180 md_write_inc+0x15/0x40 [md_mod]
which in turn put the array in dirty mode.

Best,
Marc
