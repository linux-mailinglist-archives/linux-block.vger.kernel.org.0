I only mentioned the "sector block size" alignment, not the hardware dma
alignment. The dma alignment remains the minimum address alignment you
have to use. But xfs has been able to handle dword aligned addresses for
a while now, assuming your block_device can handle dword aligned DMA.
But the old requirement for a buffer to be aligned to a 4k address
offset for a 4k block device isn't necessary anymore.

We might be talking about different things. The total length of a
vector must be a multiple of the logical block size, yes. But I'm
talking about the address offset. Right now dm-crypt can't handle a
request if the address offset is not aligned to the logical block size.
But that's a purely software created limitation, there's no hard reason
that needs to be the case.

I'm just trying to write data to disk from buffers filled by NICs
subscribed to io_uring zero-copy receive capabilities. I guess they need
fancy features to do that, but it's not that uncommon, is it? Anyway,
the data that needs to be persisted often have offsets that are still
DMA friendly, but unlikely to be perfectly page aligned.
