Cool. Thanks for that! Skimming over the series it looks good to me. The
only remaining thing I wanted to look into is bdev->bd_invalidated
handling. Because the only thing it actually indicates in practice is that
DISK_EVENT_MEDIA_CHANGE was set in check_disk_change(). All the other call
chains end up clearing bdev->bd_invalidated before it has any effect. And
that just looks very cryptic to me... So my plan was to at least move the
setting of bdev->bd_invalidated to check_disk_change() and rename it to
something saner if I cannot come up with anything better for propagating
the information from check_disk_change() to __blkdev_get().
