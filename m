I just meant that in the IO context we need to keep the information whether
IO priority is set to a particular value, or whether it is set to 0 meaning
"inherit from CPU priority". So we cannot just store the effective IO
priority immediately in the IO context instead of 0.

Yes, that would make sense as well.

Yes, good.

Yes, I also think it would be the cleanest if we made sure bio->ioprio is
always set to some value other than IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE. I'll see how we can
make that happen in the least painful way :). Thanks for your input!
