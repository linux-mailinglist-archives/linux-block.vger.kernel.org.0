The default io sched for old megraid_sas is mq-deadline, which
performs very well in Yanhui's virt workloads. And with none, IO
performance drops much with new driver(shared tags).

The disk is INTEL SSDSC2CT06.

BTW, with mq-deadline & shared tags, CPU utilization is increased by ~20%
in some VM fio test
