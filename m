More Documentation is fine, but the code needs to be improved and fully
formed before you start trying to polish with Documentation --
definitely don't put time to Documentation that is speculative!

You'd do well to focus on an implementation that doesn't require an
extra clone if interposed device will use DM (DM core already handles
cloning all incoming bios).
