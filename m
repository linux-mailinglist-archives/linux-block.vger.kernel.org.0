The git url that was used in this test points to commit:

  https://github.com/0day-ci/linux/commit/f9c499bbbf603389abad60d1931c16b2f96dee06

And that commit has an extra memset in the REQ_OP_DRV_IN/OUT case, and
it doesn't belong there. I don't see that memset in the upstream commit,
Did the bot pick up the wrong patch?
