The definition of IOPRIO_CLASS_CDL was more about reusing the ioprio *interface*
rather than having CDL support defined as a fully functional IO priority class.
As I argued in this thread, and I think you agreee, CDL semantic is more than
the simple priority class/level ordering.

See below. There may be a solution about that.

Makes sense. Though I think it will be hard to define a set of QoS hints that
are useful for a wide range of applications, and even harder to convert the
defined hint classes to CDL descriptors. I fear that we may end up with the same
issues as IO hints/streams.

OK. See below about this.

Fair point, especially given that virtio actually already forwards a guest
ioprio to the host through the virtio block command. Thinking of that particular
point together with what you said, I came up with the change show below as a
replacement for this patch 1/18.

This changes the 13-bits ioprio data into a 3-bits QOS hint + 3-bits of IO prio
level. This is consistent with the IO prio interface since IO priority levels
have to be between 0 and 7 (otherwise, errors are returned). So in fact, the
upper 10-bits of the ioprio data are ignored and we can safely use 3 of these
bits for an IO hint.

This hint applies to all priority classes and levels, that is, for the CDL case,
we can enrich any priority with a hint that specifies the CDL index to use for
an IO.

This falls short of actually defining generic IO hints, but this has the
advantage to not break anything for current applications using IO priorities,
not require any change to existing IO schedulers, while still allowing to pass
CDL indexes for IOs down to the scsi & ATA layers (which for now would be the
only layers in the kernel acting on the ioprio qos hints).

I think that this approach still allows us to enable CDL support, and on top of
it, go further and define generic QOS hints that IO scheduler can use and that
also potentially map to CDL for scsi & ata (similarly to the RT class IOs
mapping to the NCQ priority feature if the user enabled that feature).

As mentioned above, I think that defining generic IO hint classes will be
difficult. But the change below is I think a good a starting point that should
not prevent working on that.

Thoughts ?

Bart,

Given that you did not like the IOPRIO_CLASS_CDL, what do you think of this
approach ?
