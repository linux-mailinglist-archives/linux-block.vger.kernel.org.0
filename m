That seems reasonable, it becomes probably both easier and clearer by
adding a new host cap.

In any case, let me help out and cook a patch for this for the core
part (I leave the sdhci change to you). It may be a bit tricky,
especially since I have currently queued a bunch of new changes for
v5.7, that enables more users of mmc_poll_for_busy() in the core.
Maybe I need to temporarily drop them, so we can fix these problems
first. I will check.

Probably, I would also name the cap MMC_CAP_HW_NEED_RSP_BUSY, as that
seems to be describing the common problem we have for sdhci
omap/tegra.

Finally, it seems like MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY should be set for
sdhci- tegra, so while at it, perhaps you can cook a patch for that as
well.

Kind regards
Uffe
