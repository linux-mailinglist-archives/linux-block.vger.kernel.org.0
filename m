OK, got it, and it should be fine to just check REQ_HIPRI here. But as
you mentioned, it should be rare, even though not, the cost is small
too.

If it isn't rare, one solution is to extend current bio based polling
for split bios.

OK, looks we can deal with that by simply calling blk_bio_poll_io_drain()
at the entry of exit_io_context()
