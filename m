Yeah, performance does drop when queue depth is cut to half if queue
depth is low enough.

However, it isn't enough to just test perf over one LUN, what is the
perf effect when running IOs over the 2 or 5 data LUNs concurrently?

SATA should have similar issue too, and I think the improvement may be
more generic to bypass fair tag sharing in case of low queue depth
(such as < 32) if turns out the fair tag sharing doesn't work well
in case low queue depth.

Also the 'fairness' could be enhanced dynamically by scsi LUN's queue depth,
which can be adjusted dynamically.


Thanks,
