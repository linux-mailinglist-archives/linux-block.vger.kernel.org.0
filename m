We proudly announce the second Alpine Linux Persistence and Storage
Summit (ALPSS), which will be held October 1st to October 4th 2019 at
the Lizumerhuette [1][2] in Austria .

The goal of this conference is to discuss the hot topics in Linux storage
and file systems, such as persistent memory, NVMe, Zoned Block Device,
and PCIe peer to peer transfers in a cool and relaxed setting with
spectacular views in the Austrian alps.

We plan to have a small selection of short and to the point talks with
lots of room for discussion in small groups, as well as ample downtime
to enjoy the surrounding.

Attendance is free except for the accommodation and food at the lodge [3],
but the number of seats is strictly limited.  If you are interested in
attending please reserve a seat by mailing your favorite topic(s) to:

	alpss-pc@lists.infradead.org

If you are interested in giving a short and crisp talk please also send
an abstract to the same address.

Note: The Lizumerhuette is an Alpine Society lodge in a high alpine
environment.  A hike of approximately 2 hours is required to the lodge,
and no other accommodations are available within walking distance.

More details will eventually be available on our website:

        http://www.alpss.at/
