Let's refine my wording, the above should be "... by the time the final
lo_release is called".  blkdev_put_whole ensures all writeback has finished
and all buffers are gone by writing all data back and waiting for it and then
truncating the pages from blkdev_flush_mapping.

This looks completely spurious to me.  Adding Ming who added it.
