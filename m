That's probably why I couldn't reproduce this in a vm.  This time I set 
up one poll queue in a 8 cpu vm and reproduced it.

Is that always true?

Let's say the operation was __io_submit_sqe()->io_read()

By "failing to submit the io", do you mean that 
io_read()->call_read_iter() returned success or failure?  Are you saying 
that req->result was set from kiocb_done() or later in the block layer?

Anyway I assume that io_read() would have to return success since 
otherwise __io_submit_sqe() would immediately return and not check 
req->result:

         if (ret)
                 return ret;

So if io_read() did return success,  are we guaranteed that setting 
req->result = -EAGAIN would always happen before the check?

Also, is it possible that we can be preempted in __io_submit_sqe() after 
the call to io_read() but before the -EAGAIN check?

Ah yes, it's a different io_ring_ctx, different poll list etc. For my 
own clarity, I assume all contexts are mapping the same actual sq/cq rings?
