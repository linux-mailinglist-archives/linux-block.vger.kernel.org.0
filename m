Hey Ming, thanks for taking a look at this.

Well, it depends -- currently read() works (without I/O errors) and
write() fails (ENOSPC).
Example tests are provided below.

And that's consistent before and after attach/detach; so, I thought
fsync() should follow.

That is indeed one of the issues. There's also a monitoring/alerting
perspective that
would benefit; e.g., sosreport runs parted, it's run on data
collection for support cases.
Now, that I/O error message is thrown in the logs, and some mon/alert
tools might not
yet have filters to ignore (detached) loop devices, and alert. It'd be
nice to deflect that.

It's not a common issue, to be honest; but the consistency point
seemed fair to me,
as essentially the current code doesn't deinitialize something it
previously initialized,
and the block device is left running with that enabled regardless.

cheers,

Setup:

    # DEV=/dev/loop7
    # IMG=/tmp/image
    # truncate --size 1M $IMG

Before attach/detach:

    # dd if=$DEV of=/dev/null
    0+0 records in
    0+0 records out
    0 bytes copied, 0.00011206 s, 0.0 kB/s

    # echo $?
    0

    # dd if=/dev/zero of=$DEV
    dd: writing to '/dev/loop7': No space left on device
    1+0 records in
    0+0 records out
    0 bytes copied, 0.000229225 s, 0.0 kB/s

    # echo $?
    1

After attach/detach: (same)

    # losetup $DEV $IMG
    # losetup -d $DEV

    # dd if=$DEV of=/dev/null
    0+0 records in
    0+0 records out
    0 bytes copied, 0.000102131 s, 0.0 kB/s

    # echo $?
    0

    # dd if=/dev/zero of=$DEV
    dd: writing to '/dev/loop7': No space left on device
    1+0 records in
    0+0 records out
    0 bytes copied, 0.000259658 s, 0.0 kB/s

    # echo $?
    1
