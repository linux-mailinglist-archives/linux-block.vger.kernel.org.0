Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/16] bcache: extend bucket size to 32bit width

Ths RFC patch series is an effort to extent bucket_size from 16bit to
32bit width. This is the code base for next step to use zoned device as
cache device.

In this series, these changes should be noticed,
- Increase the super block version to
	BCACHE_SB_VERSION_CDEV_WITH_FEATURES 5
	BCACHE_SB_VERSION_BDEV_WITH_FEATURES 6
- The new version adds 3 new members,
	__le64          feature_compat;
	__le64          feature_incompat;
	__le64          feature_ro_compat;
  If new feature added will change the on-disk format, just setting the
  feature set bits, no need to upstream super block version.
- The in-memory struct cache_sb does not exactly map the on-disk struct
  cache_sb_disk.
- Add 32bit bucket_size_hi in struct cache_sb_disk,
	__le32          bucket_size_hi;
  In theory bucket_size can be extended to 48bit, but now 32bit width is
  big enough.
- Other changes to follow the large bucket size.

The changes are mostly on cache device, except the super block update
there is no change about the backing device.

Currently the code survives with basic testing. I post the series a bit
ealier for comments. More fixes and changes will show up in next version
RFC patches.

Thanks in advance.
