Hi Michael, hi Joanne.

@Joanne: I am cc'ing you in this patch as I bet you might be able to 
confirm whether the rdb_CylBlocks value in Amiga RDB is big endian. I 
hope you do not mind. I would assume that everything in Amiga RDB is big 
endian, but I bet you know for certain.

While I did not specifically check myself I would be highly surprised in 
case anything in RDB data structure would be little endian. Amiga is a 
big endian platform. I'd expect little endian only to be used where 
there was need to interface with little endian platforms – like in PC 
emulators.

It may not be easy to find any confirmation in developer documentation, 
I'd assume that wherever it would not have been stated differently, big 
endian is assumed for AmigaOS.

So "be32_to_cpu" converts big to little endian in case the CPU 
architecture Linux runs on is little endian?

Well again… I'd say it is safe to assume that anything in Amiga RDB is 
big endian.
