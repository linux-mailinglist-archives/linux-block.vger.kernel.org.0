User space tasks are kicked away once the CPU is cleared in the active
set, which is the very first operation on unplug.

Unbound kthreads are handled the same way as user space tasks.

Per CPU kthreads can run until the CPU clears the online bit which is at
the very end of the unplug operation just before it dies.

Some of these kthreads are managed and stop earlier, e.g. workqueues.
