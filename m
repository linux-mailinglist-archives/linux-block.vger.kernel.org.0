Except DNR or ENODEV, we can not know namespace change or not. This is
a low-probability event. In accordance with the principle of minor
influence and no suspicion, we assume namespace not change, maybe
a good choice. If the namespace is changed, the corresponding processing
is performed during the access, which does not cause any problem.

Agree.
Not only ENOMEM, If we do not know namespace change or not, assume
namespace not change maybe a good choice.
