OK, so I think I understand the lockdep complaint better. Lockdep
essentially complains about the following scenario:

blkdev_put()
  lock disk->open_mutex
  lo_release
    __loop_clr_fd()
        |
        | wait for IO to complete
        v
loop worker
  write to backing file
    sb_start_write(file)
        |
        | wait for fs with backing file to unfreeze
        v
process holding fs frozen
  freeze_super()
        |
        | wait for remaining writers on the fs so that fs can be frozen
        v
sendfile()
  sb_start_write()
  do_splice_direct()
        |
        | blocked on read from /sys/power/resume, waiting for kernfs file
	| lock
        v
write() "/dev/loop0" (in whatever form) to /sys/power/resume
  calls blkdev_get_by_dev("/dev/loop0")
    lock disk->open_mutex => deadlock

So there are three other ingredients to this locking loop besides loop device
behavior:
1) sysfs files which serialize reads & writes
2) sendfile which holds freeze protection while reading data to write
3) "resume" file behavior opening bdev from write to sysfs file

We cannot sensibly do anything about 1) AFAICT. You cannot get a coherent
view of a sysfs file while it is changing.

We could actually change 2) (to only hold freeze protection while splicing
from pipe) but that will fix the problem only for sendfile(2). E.g.
splice(2) may also block waiting for data to become available in the pipe
while holding freeze protection. Changing that would require some surgery
in our splice infrastructure and at this point I'm not sure whether we
would not introduce other locking problems due to pipe_lock lock ordering.

For 3), we could consider stuff like not resuming from a loop device or
postponing resume to a workqueue but it all looks ugly.

Maybe the most disputable thing in this locking chain seems to be splicing
from sysfs files. That does not seem terribly useful and due to special
locking and behavior of sysfs files it allows for creating interesting lock
dependencies. OTOH maybe there is someone out there who (possibly
inadvertedly through some library) ends up using splice on sysfs files so
chances for userspace breakage, if we disable splice for sysfs, would be
non-negligible. Hum, tough.
