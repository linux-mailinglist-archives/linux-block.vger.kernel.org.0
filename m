The above test just shows that IO merge plays important role here, and
one important point for triggering IO merge is that .get_budget returns
false.

If sdev->queue_depth is too big, .get_budget may never return false.

That is why this patch just bypasses .device_busy for SSD.

There are many such HBAs, for which sdev->queue_depth is smaller than
.can_queue, especially in case of small number of LUNs.

It is only true for some HBAs.
