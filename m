I see how the offline transition collides with this model. But can we
agree that the zone attributes is something that fits here?

I guess what I am struggle with here is that you see the capacity
feature as a different extension than the attributes and the offline
transition.

The way I see it, there are things the device supports and things that
the driver supports. ZAC/ZBC does not support a size != capacity, but
the driver sets these values to be the same. One thing I struggle with
is that saying that we support capacity and setting size = capacity puts
the burden in the user to check these values across all zones to
determine if they can support the driver or not. I think it would be
clear to have a feature explicitly stating that capacity != size.

For the attributes, this is very similar - some apply, some don't, and
we only report the ones that make sense for each driver. I do not see
how device mappers are treated differently here than in the existing
capacity features.

For the offline transition, I see that the current patches do not set
flags properly and we would need to inherit the underlying device if we
want to do it this way. I can understand from your comments that this is
not a good way of doing it. I see in one of your comments from V1 that
we could deal with this transition in the scsi driver and keep it in
memory (i.e., device is still read-only, but driver transitions to
offline) - can you comment on this?
