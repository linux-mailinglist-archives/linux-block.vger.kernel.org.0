I can tell you we there is an existing NPO2 ZNS customer which chimed on
the discussion and they described having to carry a delta to support
NPO2 ZNS. So if you cannot tell me of a ZNS application which is going to
break to add NPO2 support then your original point is not valid of
suggesting that there would be a break.

No one is saying otherwise.

They must not be ZNS. So they can continue to chug on.

They are not ZNS so they don't have to worry about ZNS.

ZNS applications must be aware of that fact that NPO2 can exist.
ZNS applications must be aware of that fact that any vendor may one day
sell NPO2 devices.

Ugly is relative and subjective. NAND does not force PO2.

That seems to be an incorrect assumption given ZNS drives exist
with NPO2. So you can probably say that some SMR applications can work
with PO2 ZNS drives. That is a more correct statement.

We already determined you cannot identify any ZNS specific application
which would break.

SMR != ZNS

If you really want to use SMR applications for ZNS that seems to be
a bit beyond the scope of this discussion, but it seems to me that those
SMR applications should simply learn that if a device is ZNS that NPO2 can
be expected.

As technologies evolve so do specifications.

It's a reality though. Devices exist, and so do users. And they're
carrying their own delta to support NPO2 ZNS today on Linux.

This conversation is about the reality that ZNS NPO2 exist and how best to
support that. You seem to want to negate that reality and support on
Linux without even considering what the changes look like to to support
ZNS NPO2.

As a maintainer I think we need to *evaluate* supporting users as best
as possible. Not denying their existance. Even if it pains us.
