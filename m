Can you please provide a link to that coding style? This is the default
formatting of rustfmt.

I would argue that this is just a matter of taste and familiarity. In
mathematics there are also several other ways to express the above.
For example $size \in [512, PAGE_SIZE]$.

That is because the function is implemented with generics over the type
inside of the range. So if you have your own type, you can use `..` and
`..=3D` to create ranges. For big structs you wouldn't use by-value even
in C and C++.

Don't get me wrong, we can have a discussion about this. I just think
that it is not as clear-cut as you make it out to be.

As I said above, it's a matter of familiarity. I don't think that using
contains is inherently worse.

Sure, but in this case, I don't think everything is in the function
signature.

We currently don't have that function in Rust. Also note that in
contrast to C, this function is private. So no driver is able to call it
anyways.

In this case, documentation is not really necessary, as we only require
it for publicly facing functions. But for those I think it is useful to
reiterate what the code does. They might be the entrypoint for first
time kernel developers and giving them an easier time of understanding
is IMO a good thing.
