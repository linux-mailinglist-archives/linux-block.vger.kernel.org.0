The only constraint at the BIO level for writing to a zone is "issue the write
BIOs sequentially". So multiple write BIOs *can* be issued to a zone. The "one
write per zone in flight at any time" implemented with zone write locking
happens at the request level in the block IO scheduler, so underneath the file
system. So the issue can indeed happen.

But what you said could actually provide a solution: have the FS issue regular
writes one at a time if the writes have priorities.
