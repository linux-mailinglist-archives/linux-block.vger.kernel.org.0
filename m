I thought that this patchset had fundamental issues, in terms of working 
for all types of hosts. FYI, I did the backport of latest hisi_sas_v3 to 
v4.15 with this patchset (as you may have noticed in my git send 
mistake), but we have not got to test it yet.

On a related topic, we did test exposing reply queues as blk-mq hw 
queues and generating the host-wide tag internally in the LLDD with 
sbitmap, and unfortunately we were experiencing a significant 
performance hit, like 2300K -> 1800K IOPs for 4K read.

We need to test this further. I don't understand why we get such a big hit.

So you're saying that removing this reply queue stuff can make the 
solution to the problem more generic, but do you have an idea of the 
overall solution?

It would still be good to have a forward port of this patchset for 
testing, if we're serious about it. Or at least this bug you mention fixed.

thanks again,
John
