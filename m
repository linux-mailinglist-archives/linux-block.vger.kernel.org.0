My quick read missed that, which is why you're using chaining. Then it
looks very reasonable to me.

That'd be better, and preferably a test with pinning etc so that you can
show more consistent results. Just reading your table does indeed look
like there's a performance degradation, even if you preface it by saying
there is none. It would need better explaining, but preferably better
testing.

it totally is, I was the one missing that.
