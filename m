I'd rather test against latest mainline, but if it is too difficult then 
I can backport LLDD stuff and test against 4.15. It may take a while.

But we want a tag unique in range [0, host tag count), which 
blk_mq_unique_tag() does not provide.

On topic of internal commands, I assume that the approach would be to 
reserve tags in blk_mq_tag_set.reserved_tags (currently not set in 
scsi_mq_setup_tags()), and the LLDD would use 
blk_mq_alloc_request(,,BLK_MQ_REQ_RESERVED) to get a tag.

I guess that this may be Hannes' idea also (see "as then the block layer 
maintains all tags, and is able to figure out if the queue really is 
quiesced").
