Yes, because handling IO need the associated io_uring commend reached to ubd driver
first.

But it has to work at least. Also not see real simplification in your
suggestion.

GETDATA command has been removed, because task_work_add() is used to
complete io_uring command(UBD_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ or UBD_IO_FETCH_REQ),
so pinning pages and copying data is always done in ubdsrv daemon
context.

You may not get the whole idea:

1) UBD_IO_FETCH_REQ is only submitted to ubd driver before starting
device because at the beginning there isn't any IO handled, so no need
to send COMMIT.

2) after device is started, only UBD_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ is
submitted for both committing io handling result to driver and fetching new
io request, and UBD_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ can be thought as combined
command of COMMIT and UBD_IO_FETCH_REQ.

3) COMMIT command is just submitted after queue is aborted, since we
needn't to fetch request any more, and just need to commit in-flight
request's result to ubd driver.

If you meant using COMMIT with io_gen_cqe_direct(), what benefit can we
get? Still one command is required for handling IO, that is exactly what
UBD_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ is doing.

UBDSRV_NEED_FETCH_RQ means the to be queued io_uring command has to fetch
new io request from ubd driver.

> #define UBDSRV_NEED_COMMIT_RQ_COMP (1UL << 1)

UBDSRV_NEED_COMMIT_RQCOMP means the to be queued io_uring command has to
commit io handling result to ubd driver.

> #define UBDSRV_IO_FREE (1UL << 2)

Only io with this flag can be queued to ubd driver. Once this flag is
cleared, it means the io command has been submitted to ubd driver.

> #define UBDSRV_IO_HANDLING (1UL << 3)

UBDSRV_IO_HANDLING means the io command is being handled by target code.

> #define UBDSRV_NEED_GET_DATA (1UL << 4)

The above one has been removed.

Figuring out perfect name is always not easy, but I don't think they
are weird since the above short comments explained them clearly.
