I have looked at this proposal again, that being to quiesce all (other) 
request queues prior to freeing the IO scheduler tags+requests. I tried 
this and it seems to work (changes not shown), in terms of solving the 
issue of blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() and freeing the requests+tags 
racing. However, I am still not sure if it is acceptable to quiesce all 
request queues like this just when changing IO scheduler, even if it is 
done elsewhere.

In addition, this still leaves the blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() issue; that 
being that freeing requests+tags can race against that same function. 
There is nothing to stop blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() taking a reference to 
a request and that request being freed in parallel when switching IO 
scheduler, however unlikely.

Solving that becomes trickier. As Ming pointed out, that function can be 
called from softirq and even hard irq context - like 
ufshcd_tmv_handler() -> blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() -  so there is a 
locking context issue.

Thanks,
John
