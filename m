Hi Ming-

>Will NVMe HDD support multiple NS?

At this point it doesn't seem like an NVMe HDD could benefit from
multiple namespaces. However, a multiple actuator HDD can present the
actuators as independent channels that are capable of independent
media access. It seems that we would want them on separate namespaces,
or sets. I'd like to discuss the pros and cons of each, and which
would be better for system integration.

Best regards,
