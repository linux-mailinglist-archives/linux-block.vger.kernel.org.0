Yes, we share tags among all queues, but we generate the tag - known as 
IPTT - in the LLDD now, as we can no longer use the request tag (as it 
is not unique per all queues):

https://github.com/hisilicon/kernel-dev/commit/087b95af374be6965583c1673032fb33bc8127e8#diff-f5d8fff19bc539a7387af5230d4e5771R188

As I said, the branch is messy and I did have to fix 087b95af374.

I really do think now that I'll make this change on mainline to avoid 
doubt...
