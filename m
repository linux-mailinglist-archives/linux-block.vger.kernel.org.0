And as I said, users asked for it.

Backward compatibility ? We must not break userspace...

The block layer is not the issue here. We all understand that one is easy=
.

zonefs can trivially support non power of 2 zone sizes, but as zonefs
creates a discrete view of the device capacity with its one file per
zone interface, an application accesses to a zone are forcibly limited
to that zone, as they should. With zonefs, pow2 and nonpow2 devices will
show the *same* interface to the application. Non power of 2 zone size
then have absolutely no benefits at all.

And what makes you think that this is acceptable ? What guarantees do
you have that this will not be a problem for users out there ?
