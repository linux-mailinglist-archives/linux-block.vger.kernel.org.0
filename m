Hi Ming,

Thanks for the info, and sorry for not noticing the fix merged on Jun, 3rd
on the master branch.  I will follow that branch when testing and submit
fixes I find along the way.

I guess you have considered a lot of names, but I'd suggest any of:

 * blkuser,
 * ublk
 * BUSE (as in Block FUSE, though there is another non-upstream
project with that name),
 * UBIO (as in UIO, but for Block IO)
 * B2U (Block IO Backed by userspace) :-P

TBH, my favorite is ublk.

Thank you,
