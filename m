Yes, anyone can do a mknod and attempt to open a device that isn't
present.

when devtmpfs creates the device node, it should be there.  Unless it
gets removed, and then added back, so you could race with userspace, but
that's not normal.

As I say above, that's not normal, and you have to be root to do this,
so I don't understand what you are trying to prevent happening?  What is
the bug and why is it just showing up now (i.e. what changed to cause
it?)
