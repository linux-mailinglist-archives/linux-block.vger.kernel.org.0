I suspect the problem is to do with the way we search for the new block in the 
space map for the previous transaction (sm->old_ll), and then increment in the current
transaction (sm->ll).

We keep old_ll around so we can ensure we never (re) allocate a block that's used in
the previous transaction.  This gives us our crash resistance, since if anything goes
wrong we effectively rollback to the previous transaction.

What I think we should be doing is running find_free on the old_ll, then double checking
it's not actually used in the current transaction.  ATM we're relying on smd->begin being
set properly everywhere, and I suspect this isn't the case.  A quick look shows sm_disk_inc_block()
doesn't adjust it.  sm_disk_inc_block() can be called when breaking sharing of a neighbouring entry
in a leaf btree node ... and we know you use snapshots very heavily.

I'll get a patch to you later today.
