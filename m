Hello,

What matters isn't that they have a featured with the same name but the
actual circumstances. e.g. for nvme, FUA has been there from the beginning
and we used it from the beginning so we know that they're safe. For ATA,
it's something added later on and we know that there are a bunch of devices
which choke on it and we don't know whether anyone else is using it at any
scale.

Someone should benchmark it but it's likelyt that PREFLUSH | FUA vs.
PREFLUSH | WRITE | POSTFLUSH isn't gonna show any meaningful difference in
any realistic scenario. The main gain of NCQ'd FUA is that we don't have to
drain the in-flight commands but PREFLUSH needs that anyway.

This part hopefully is answered above.

All that said, yeah, if we restrict it to only the newest devices, they're
more likely to be well behaved and a lot more visible when they misbehave.
That sounds reasonable to me.

Thanks.
