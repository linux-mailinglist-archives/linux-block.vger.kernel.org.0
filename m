Well, I believe that having an explicit documentation that large cache
requires more tim to initialize is quite reasonable way forward. We
already do have similar situations with memory hotplug on extra large
machines with a small block size.

What exactly are going to do about this situation? If you want to bail
out then you should simply do that on any pending fatal signal. Why is
OOM special?

All processes which can finish in the default timeout are not going to
regress when the forcefull temination happens later. I cannot really
comment on the systemd part because I am not familiar with internals but
the mere existence of the timeout suggests that the workflow should be
prepared for longer timeouts because initialization taking a long time
is something we have to live with. Something just takes too long to
initialized.

The problem is that you are effectivelly violating signal delivery
semantic because you are ignoring user signal without userspace ever
noticing. That to me sounds like a free ticket to all sorts of
hard-to-debug problems. What if the userspace expects the signal to be
handled? Really, you want to increase the existing timeout to workaround
it. If you can make the initialization process more swift then even
better.

I have a vague recollection that there are mutlitple timeouts and
setting only some is not sufficient.
