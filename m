If use blk_mq_quiesce_tagset, it will quiesce all queues of all ns,
but can not set NVME_NS_STOPPED of all ns. The mechanism of NVME_NS_STOPPED
will be invalidated.
NVMe-pci has very complicated quiesce/unquiesce use pattern, quiesce/unquiesce
may be called unpaired.
It will cause some backward. There may be some bugs in this scenario:
A thread: quiesce the queue
B thread: quiesce the queue
A thread end, and does not unquiesce the queue.
B thread: unquiesce the queue, and do something which need the queue must be unquiesed.

Of course, I don't think it is a good choice to guarantee paired access through NVME_NS_STOPPED,
there exist unexpected unquiesce and start queue too early.
But now that the code has done so, the backward should be unacceptable.
such as this scenario:
A thread: quiesce the queue
B thread: want to quiesce the queue but do nothing because NVME_NS_STOPPED is already set.
A thread: unquiesce the queue
Now the queue is unquiesced too early for B thread.
B thread: do something which need the queue must be quiesced.

Introduce NVME_NS_STOPPED link:
