I think if we do the ->private cleanup that Peter mentioned, then
there's not much left in terms of consolidation. Not convinced the case
is interesting enough to warrant a special helper. If others show up,
it's easy enough to consolidate the use cases and unify them.

If you look at wake_up_nr(), I would have thought that would be more
widespread. But it really isn't.

Gotcha, thanks.
