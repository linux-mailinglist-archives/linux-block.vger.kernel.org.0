I reduced system memory and attached bunch of devices in short time so that
memory pressure occurs while device attachments are ongoing.  Under this
circumstance, I was able to see the race.

Extending this callback in that way would be still not too hard.  We could use
the argument to the callback.  I would keep the argument of the callback to
'struct device *' as is, and will add a comment saying 'NULL' value of the
argument means every devices.  As an example, xenbus would pass NULL-ending
array of the device pointers that need to free its resources.

After seeing this race, I am now also thinking it could be better to delegate
detailed control of each device to its driver, as some drivers have some
complicated and unique relation with its devices.

I didn't used the reference count manipulation operations because other similar
parts also didn't.  But, if there is no implicit reference count guarantee, it
seems those operations are indeed necessary.

That said, as get/put operations only adjust the reference count, those will
not make the callback to wait until the linking of the 'backend' and 'blkif' to
the device (xen_blkbk_probe()) is finished.  Thus, the race could still happen.
Or, am I missing something?

I also modified the code to do 'get_device()' and 'put_device()' as you
suggested and did test, but the race was still reproducible.
