Correct __set_page_dirty_nobuffers() is supposed to be called serialized
with truncation either through page lock or other means. At least the
comment says so and the code looks like that.

I suppose you mean __set_page_dirty() here.

I'm not sure where we depend here on page->mapping not getting cleared. The
point is even if page->mapping is getting cleared while we work on the
page, we have 'mapping' stored locally so we just account everything
against the original mapping. 

I've researched this a bit more and commit 2d6d7f982846 "mm: protect
set_page_dirty() from ongoing truncation" introduced the idea that
__set_page_dirty_nobuffers() should be only called synchronized with
truncation. Now I know for a fact that this is not always the case (e.g.
various RDMA drivers calling set_page_dirty() without a lock or any other
protection against truncate) but let's consider this a bug in the caller of
set_page_dirty(). So in the end I agree that you're fine with relying on
page_mapping() not changing under you.
