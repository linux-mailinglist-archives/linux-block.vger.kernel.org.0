Because zones before data_offset should not visible by upper layer code,
such zones should not be sent to cached_dev_report_zones_cb(). This is a
double check that caller of cached_dev_report_zones_cb() does things in
correct way.

Correct me if I am wrong. I assume when the zone is in empty condition,
LBA of zone->wp should be exactly equal to zone->start before bcache
does the conversion. Therefore 'zone->wp - data_offset' should still be
equal to 'zone->start - data_offset'. Therefore explicitly handle it in
'case BLK_ZONE_COND_EMPTY:' should be equal to handle it in 'default:' part.

Just want to double check I understand the wp correctly, thanks.

I see. Now it is more clear to me. Thanks.
