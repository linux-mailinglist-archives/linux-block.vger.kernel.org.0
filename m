This concerns me as well, it seems like the SCSI ML should have it's
own per-device attribute if we actually need to control this per-device
instead of on a per-host or per-driver basis.  And it seems like this
is something that is specific to high-performance drivers, so changing
the way this works for all drivers seems a bit much.

Ordinarily I'd prefer a host template attribute as Sumanesh proposed,
but I dislike wrapping the examination of that and the queue flag in
a macro that makes it not obvious how the behavior is affected.
(Plus Hannes just submitted submitted the patches to remove .use_cmd_list,
which was another piece of ML functionality used by only a few drivers.)

Ming's patch does freeze the queue if NONROT is changed by sysfs, but
the flag can be changed by other kernel code, e.g. sd_revalidate_disk()
clears it and then calls sd_read_block_characteristics() which may set
it again.  So it's not clear to me how reliable this is.
