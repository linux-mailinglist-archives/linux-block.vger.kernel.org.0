Commit bdc48fa11e46f867 ("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning")
updated max length from 80 to 100, and Documentation/process/coding-style.rst says

  The preferred limit on the length of a single line is 80 columns.

  Statements longer than 80 columns should be broken into sensible chunks,
  unless exceeding 80 columns significantly increases readability and does
  not hide information.

. But this case did not increase readability?

The "const" can be added to non pointer arguments for annotating that
the corresponding argument will not change inside a function.

The point of these helpers is to

  annotate that lo->lo_state can be updated only by these helpers

and

  make sure that appropriate locks are held for synchronization

. If there is a location doing direct "lo->lo_state = Lo_*;" assignment,
it is likely a sign of a bug.

loop_validate_spinlock protects lo_state of all loop devices, for
loop_validate_file() needs to traverse on remote loop devices.
By changing/checking lo_state with loop_validate_spinlock held,

  f = l->lo_backing_file;

in loop_validate_file() is guaranteed to refer to a stable file
(e.g. __loop_clr_fd() is not in progress).


Currently only __loop_clr_fd() is protected by Lo_rundown, and
loop_change_fd()/loop_configure() will be protected by Lo_binding by this patch.

Since there are functions where dedicated Lo_* is not yet used (e.g.
loop_set_status(), loop_get_status(), lo_simple_ioctl()), these helpers
for now need to also hold lo->lo_mutex for serializing against these functions.
If all functions which hold lo->lo_mutex are updated to use dedicated Lo_*,
we can remove lo->lo_mutex.
