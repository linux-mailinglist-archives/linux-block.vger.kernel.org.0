Yes, those are easy.

Are we sure blk_queue_rq_timeout is never called from anything but
probe?  Either way given that this is a limit that isn't directly
corelated with anything else simply using WRITE_ONCE/READ_ONCE might
be enough.

Yes.

Yeah.

Yes, limits_lock sounds sensible here.

Agreed.  Although updating both flags isn't atomic that should be
harmless in this case (but could use a comment about that).

Yes.

Yes.

So I think the first step here is to remove the locking from
queue_attr_store/queue_attr_show and move it into the attributes that
still need it in some form, followed by replacing it with the more
suitable locks as defined above.  And maybe with a little bit more
work we can remove sysfs_lock entirely eventually.
