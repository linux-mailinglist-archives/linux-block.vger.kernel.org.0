Yes, but the q_usage_counter protection for bio based queue is just for
calling ->submit_bio(), which is added in:

3ef28e83ab15 block: generic request_queue reference counting

Also we never support to drain in-flight IO for bio based queue, and
this patch doesn't make a difference on this area.

Draining bio based queue is always driver's responsibility, block
layer never supports that.


Thanks,
