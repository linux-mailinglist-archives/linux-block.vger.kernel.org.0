device mapper support. Please send patches that cover all zoned block devic=

From the user (application or in-kernel) perspective, *all* zoned device no=
w=0A=
have a zone capacity. I do not think it matters if that comes from the devi=
ce or=0A=
from the driver. It is unconditionally supported. The report flag=0A=
BLK_ZONE_REP_CAPACITY exist to signal to user applications that the zone=0A=
descriptor has the capactiy field, to allow for backward compatibility with=
=0A=
older kernels. See patches for fio or util-linux blkzone posted to see its =
use.=0A=

The capacity feature is supported by *all* zoned block device. Support comi=
ng=0A=
from the device or from the driver does not matter. The API is consistent f=
or=0A=
all device types. So in my opinion, there is no need to consider zone capac=

as an attribute. It is supported by everything, it is now part of the API,=

You are mixing up the report flags describing the structure of the zone=0A=
descriptor API with optional device features attributes. Adding an attribut=
e=0A=
field to the report zones descriptors is fine. The presence of that field c=
an be=0A=
signaled with a BLK_ZONE_REP_ATTR report flag as you already proposed. No p=

But then, imagine a device mapper target using multiple devices with differ=

That would not be persistent across reboot, unlike for ZNS drive. So forget=

about this. That was wishful thinking from me. This will not work.=0A=

Explicit zone offlining is truly an optional feature of the device. Signali=
ng=0A=
its support to the user is necessary, but again, I would like that to be do=
ne in=0A=
a way that does not force device mapper targets to forever report nothing f=

the optional features. A flag field can certainly be used, but it has to  b=
