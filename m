What are 3 different problems? I am asking since I remember only two:
one for CPU multistate and the other one for sysfs during rmmod.
The missing one from my view would help why you are saying they
are all different problems(even though it's a bit releated).

Yeah, let me try something with kobject stuff how I could go far
but let me understand what I was missing from problems your mentioned
above.

It's true but is it a big problem? There are many cases that system
just return error if it's busy and rely on the admin. IMHO, rmmod should
be part of them.

How does the try_module_get solved the problem? I thought it's
general problem on every sysfs knobs in zram. Do you mean
you will add module_get/put for every sysfs knobs in zram?

It would be great but that's not the one we have atm so want to
proceed to fix anyway.

So idea is refcount of the block_device's inode and module_exit path
checks also the inode refcount to make rmmod failure?
Hmm, might work but I am not sure it's right layerm, too.
