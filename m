Hi Christoph,

The UFSHCI specification is very clear about the requirement that UFS 
host controllers must process SCSI commands in order if host software 
sets one bit at a time in the UFSHCI 3.0 doorbell register: "For Task 
Management Requests and Transfer Requests, software may issue multiple 
commands at a time, and may issue new commands before previous commands 
have completed. When software sets the corresponding doorbell register, 
the Task Management Requests and Transfer Requests automatically get a 
time stamp with their issue time. The commands within a command list 
(Task Management List or Transfer Request List) shall be processed in
the order of their time stamps, starting from the oldest time stamp. In 
the case multiple commands from the same list have the same time stamp, 
they shall be processed in the order of their command list index,
starting from the lowest index."

Damien and Jens agree about introducing an additional hardware queue for 
preserving the order of zoned writes as one can see here: 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/ed255a4a-a0da-a962-2da4-13321d0a75c5@kernel.dk/

In our tests pipelining zoned writes (REQ_OP_WRITE) works fine as long 
as the UFS error handler is not activated. After the UFS error handler 
has been scheduled and before the SCSI host state is changed into 
SHOST_RECOVERY, the UFS host controller driver responds with 
SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY. I'm still working on a solution for the 
reordering caused by this mechanism.

Thanks,

Bart.
