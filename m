It seems the principal technical problem is the one described here:

https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mmc/msg26602.html

I don't see any way to solve this completely, as there seem to be two
fundamentally conflicting requirements:

1) If a mounted SD card is replaced, it must be assigned a new
/dev/mmcblkN
2) /dev/mmcblkN should always match the configured alias IDs

What is the reason we need 1) - is it possible to have multiple eMMCs
or SD cards on a single bus, with detection at runtime? Otherwise I'd
expect this to be handled like other drives with removable media (CD,
floppy), with static device assignment.

If we can't give up on 1) for some reason, we'll have to accept that we
can't guarantee 2) unconditionally. As far as I can tell, the patches
provided by Sascha and others did that in a reasonable way: The aliases
would work in most cases - in particular for the first assignment on
boot, which is required to find the correct rootfs.
