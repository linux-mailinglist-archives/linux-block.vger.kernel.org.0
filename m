Ah now I see what you are getting at, yes that's clearly a bug! I wonder
how we best safely can batch the drops. We can track the number of times
we've used the same files, and do atomic_sub_and_test() in a
put_files_struct_many() type addition. But that would leave us open to
the issue you describe, where someone could maliciously overflow the
files ref count.

Probably not worth over-optimizing, as long as we can avoid the
current->files task lock/unlock and shuffle.

I'll update the patch.
