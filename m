request_queue is also abstract in block I/O's implementation, which
can be thought as one lower level concept of gendisk too, IMO.

Can you explain what the bits are in blk_cleanup_queue() for dealing with FS
I/O state? blk_cleanup_queue() drains and shutdown the queue basically,
all shouldn't be related with gendisk, and it is fine to implement one
queue without gendisk involved, such as nvme admin, connect queue or
sort of stuff.

Wrt. this reported issue, rq_qos_exit() needs to run before releasing
gendisk, but queue has to put into freezing before calling
rq_qos_exit(), so looks you suggest to move the following code into
del_gendisk()?


        WARN_ON_ONCE(blk_queue_registered(q));

        /* mark @q DYING, no new request or merges will be allowed afterwards */
        blk_set_queue_dying(q);

        blk_queue_flag_set(QUEUE_FLAG_NOMERGES, q);
        blk_queue_flag_set(QUEUE_FLAG_NOXMERGES, q);

        /*
         * Drain all requests queued before DYING marking. Set DEAD flag to
         * prevent that blk_mq_run_hw_queues() accesses the hardware queues
         * after draining finished.
         */
        blk_freeze_queue(q);

        rq_qos_exit(q);

If we move the above into del_gendisk(), some corner cases have to be
taken care of, such as request queue without disk involved.

It is same with recent report of 'general protection fault in wb_timer_fn'.
