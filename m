Yeah, this one is still pending... Would be nice to make some progress
there at some point.

This is interesting, and I've pondered something like that before too. I
think it's worth investigating and hacking up a prototype. I recently
had one user of IOPOLL assume that setting up a ring with IOPOLL would
automatically create a polled queue on the driver side and that is what
would be used for IO. And while that's not how it currently works, it
definitely does make sense and we could make some things faster like
that. It would also potentially easier enable cancelation referenced in
#1 above, if it's restricted to the queue(s) that the ring "owns".
