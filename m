Hi Jens,

Here are the bcache patches for Linux v5.3. All these patches are
tested for a while and survived from my smoking and pressure testings.

This run we have Alexandru Ardelean contributes a clean up patch. The
rested patches are from me, there is an important race fix has the
following patches involved in,
- bcache: Revert "bcache: free heap cache_set->flush_btree in
  bch_journal_free"
- bcache: Revert "bcache: fix high CPU occupancy during journal"
- bcache: remove retry_flush_write from struct cache_set
- bcache: fix race in btree_flush_write()
- bcache: performance improvement for btree_flush_write()
- bcache: add reclaimed_journal_buckets to struct cache_set
On a Lenovo SR650 server (48 cores, 200G dram, 1T NVMe SSD as cache
device and 12T NVMe SSD as backing device), without this fix, bcache
can only run 40 around minutes before deadlock or panic happens. Now
I don't observe any deadlock or panic for 5+ hours smoking test.

Please pick them for Linux v5.3, and thank you in advance.
