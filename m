Yes, absolutely. In addition to this, NCQ high priority feature is optional. The
host-level RT class scheduling works the same way regardless of a SATA drive
supporting NCQ high priority or not. If ncq_prio_enable is not enabled (or not
supported), the scheduler still works as before. If ncq_prio_enable is set for a
drive that supports NCQ high prio, then the user gets the additional benefit of
*also* having the drive prioritize the commands from high-priority user IOs.

Yes. And for cases where we still need an IO scheduler (e.g. SMR with
mq-deadline), we really cannot use the priority level (CDL index) as a
meaningful information to make request scheduling decisions because I think it
is simply impossible to reliably define a "priority" order for the 7 read and
write descriptors. We cannot map a set of 14 descriptors with a very large
possible number of variations to sorted array of priority-like levels.

No need for this. We can keep the existing ncq_prio_enable and the proposed
duration_limits/enable sysfs attributes. The user cannot enable both at the same
time with our patches. So if the user enables ncq_prio_enable, then it will get
high priority NCQ commands mapping for any level of the RT class. If
duration_limits/enable is set, then the user will get CDL scheduling of commands
on the drive.

But again, the difficulty with this overloading is that we *cannot* implement a
solid level-based scheduling in IO schedulers because ordering the CDLs in a
meaningful way is impossible. So BFQ handling of the RT class would likely not
result in the most ideal scheduling (that would depend heavily on how the CDL
descriptors are defined on the drive). Hence my reluctance to overload the RT
class for CDL.

Yes. Exactly.

Agree. And as explained above, I think that reusing the RT class creates more
problems than the only apparent simplification it is.

Yes. And I think that the added complexity to correctly handle the overloaded RT
class is too much. RT class has been around for a long time for host-level IO
priority scheduling. Let's not break it in weird ways.

We certainly can work on improving handling of IOPRIO_CLASS_DL in IO schedulers.
But in my opinion, that can be done later, after this initial series introducing
CDL support is applied.
