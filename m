Definition of primadonna: 
"a very temperamental person with an inflated view of their own talent
or importance."

My issue from the start on Friday night (in private) has always been
how holier-than-thou yet abusive you've been since having discovered
this bug in dm-flakey's optional "corrupt_bio_byte" feature.

I didn't push commit 1d9a94389853 _because_ I "made no attempt to test
it".  Commit 1d9a94389853 sought to fix a similar but different
corruption in the original "corrupt_bio_byte" implementation (which
proved useful for the specific case it was first developed for).

This dm-flakey corrupt_bio_byte bug will be fixed upstream this week.

But your recap is devoid of any understanding that my responses to
this dm-devel thread, and your private messages, have primarily taken
issue with how you've chosen to conduct yourself.

I'm not aware of dm-flakey's corrupt_bio_byte being used in upstream
testing frameworks (xfstests only uses flakey's basic capabilities).

Any willingness to elevate dm-flakey's corrupt_bio_byte to wider use
in upstream testing frameworks would have uncovered the need for your
fix.  You were first to notice it.  Rather than be cool about it,
you've been hostile from the start and completely misrepresented the
significance of the bug given the limited scope of who is impacted.

I really am done responding to your escalating campaign of self-owns.
