Not for all types and not all the time. For instance the Rust block
device driver API does not always use refcounting for `struct request`.
Only when it cannot determine the lifetime of a request reference at
compile time.

The issue here is not so much use after free as it is aliasing of
mutable and shared references. This is illegal in Rust, and programs
that allow this may exhibit undefined behavior.

I understand. I am not referring to `blk_mq_opw.timeout`. The null block
driver has a feature where requests complete after a delay. This is
implemented via the `hrtimer` subsystem.

The Rust block driver API implements the `blk_mq_ops` vtable on behalf
of the driver. There is a little bit of glue code inserted between the C
symbols called by the kernel and the Rust functions that the block device
driver provides.

I understand that the driver has exclusive ownership of the request
between `queue_rq()` and `complete()`. What we want to guarantee is that
the author of a block device driver is not able to access a request
after block layer has regained ownership of the request (after complete).
The way we achieve this is by preventing block layer from calling
`__blk_mq_free_request` if the Rust driver did not destroy all
references to the request.

I understand that this is not necessary for correct operation of a
block device driver. However, it is necessary to uphold invariants of
the Rust language for references.

As I said, I understand and appreciate this design. But there is a
possibility for a buggy driver to not obey. The Rust abstractions must
prevent this buggy code from compiling at all. In Rust, it must be
impossible to call `blk_mq_tag_to_rq()` for a tag that is not owned by
the driver. `blk_mq_tag_to_rq` takes an integer, so the driver developer
can call this function with an invalid tag like
`blk_mq_tag_to_rq(tagset, 5)`. If 5 is not owned by the driver, this
will return a request pointer that will alias with mutable access. When
this pointer is converted to a Rust reference, this will give undefined
behavior. For Rust, we must prevent code like this from compiling in the
first place.

The Rust driver API does follow the design of the C driver model. It
does implement the `blk_mq_ops` vtable. Rust block drivers must
implement a set of Rust functions that very closely follow this vtable.
But when it is not possible to statically determine the lifetime of an
object, to the point where the compiler will refuse to compile the code
that violates the lifetime durations of the object, we must revert to
reference counting.

I understand that a correctly implemented block device driver will not
violate lifetime of the request structure. Incorrect driver code might
violate the lifetime though. With Rust, we must prevent incorrectly
implemented drivers from compiling at all. We need the refcount for
that. By only allowing access to the request through the refcounted
pointer in certain cases, we prevent the safe driver code from
misbehaving.

It might seem cumbersome to do this dance at first. After all, we can
just write the device drivers correctly without memory safety bugs. But
the reward for all this work is that if a device driver is implemented
in the safe subset of Rust, it _cannot_ exhibit memory safety related
bugs. We don't have to review a device driver implemented in safe Rust
for memory safety issues at all.

Best regards,
Andreas
