On the surface, #2 makes the most sense. But you'd then have to apply
some scaling before it reaches the hardware side or is factored in by
the underlying scheduler, or you could have a high priority from a
cgroup that has small share of the total resources, yet ends up being
regarded as more important than a lower priority request from a cgroup
that has a much higher share of the total resources.

Hence not really sure it makes a lot of sense... We could probably come
up with some heuristics that make some sense, but they'd still just be
heuristics.
