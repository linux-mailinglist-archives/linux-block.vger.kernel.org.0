Do you have a full kernel log for your crash?

So there are different flavors of this issue, and you reported a crash 
from blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter().

If you check:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/76190c94-c5c1-9553-5509-9969fc323544@huawei.com/

You can see how I artificially trigger an issue in 
blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter().
