The existing block layer polling semantics doesn't poll for a specific
request. Please see the blk_mq_ops driver API for the 'poll' function.
It takes a hardware context, which does not indicate a specific request.
See also the blk_poll() function, which doesn't consider any specific
request in order to break out of the polling loop.
