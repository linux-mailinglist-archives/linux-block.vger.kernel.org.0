Commit 0b96da639a48 ("bcache: ignore pending signals when creating gc
and allocator thread") explains the ignoring signal is sent from OOM
killer, which was wrong. Michal Koutný, Michal Hocko and Hannes Reinecke
point out the bcache registration process might be killed by udevd other
than the OOM killer during the system boot time due to timeout.

After more diagnose, it turns out the registration process has pending
signal after exuected for 180 seconds. Now I believe the killing signal
is indeed from udevd by the following reasons,
- The signal is only received in system boot time. If register bcache
  device in command line after boot up, no pending signal received.
  the automatic bcache registration in boot up time is performed by
  udev rule only.
- The udevd has a default timeout as 180 seconds, if a rule execution
  is not finished within 180 seconds, it will try to kill the task.
  The timeout is exactly same as the seconds I observe when bcache
  registration process receives signal.

This patch does not change executable code, just changes code comments
for why flush_signals() should be called before creating bcache gc and
allocator kernel thread, to explain things in correct way.
