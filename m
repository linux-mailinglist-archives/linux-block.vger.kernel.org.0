IMO, the reason that we need to start request after issuing is for timeout
handle function could trace the request. Here, we should make sure the request
started before the driver process (e.g sock_xmit()). Right?

Before that, if something errors occur in nbd_handle_cmd(), like -EIO, -EINVAL,
that means the request have not actually been handled. So, we also don't need
timeout handler trace it. And the dispatcher function blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list()
or blk_mq_try_issue_directly() is responsible for ending the request.

BTW, other drivers, such as nvme_queue_rq(), scsi_queue_rq(), also start request
before processing it actually. If I get it wrong, please point it out.

Thanks,
Yufen
