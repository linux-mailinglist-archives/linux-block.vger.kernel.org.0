Correct, I agree that it is an issue. I can see at least two ways how to solve it:
 1. Provide a mechanism in md accounting for outstanding IOs, storing cookie information 
    for them. md_poll() will then use valid cookie's
 2. Provide similar mechanism abstracted for stackable block devices and block layer could
    handle completions for subordinate bios in an abstracted way in blk_poll() routine.
How do you Guys see this going?
