Sorry, I didn't come down in the last shower, it's not my first bug fix.
Try consulting 'git log' and look for my name or the MAINTAINERS file.
The culprits are usually happy as was the case with this patch. It's
ack-ed and I would be very surprised if Jens Axboe doesn't accept it.

It is an obvious flaw. Fix it and move on. Alternatively supply your own
patch that ticks all the above boxes.


If you want to talk about something substantial, then why do we have a
function named sgl_free() that only works properly if, for example, the
sgl_alloc_order() function creating the sgl used order==0 ? IMO sgl_free()
should be removed or renamed.

BTW The "imperative mood" stuff in that document is nonsense, at least
in English. Wikipedia maps that term back to "the imperative" as in
"Get thee to a nunnery" and "Et tu, Brute".
