Isn't that similar to multiple namespaces where some use elevator and
others use 'none'? They're all contenting for the same shared driver
tags with racing 'has_requests()'.

And the passthrough case is special with users of that interface taking
on a greater responsibility and generally want the kernel out of the
way. I don't think anyone would purposefully run a tag intense workload
through that engine at the same time as using a generic one with the
scheduler. It definitely should still work, but it doesn't need to be
fair, right?
