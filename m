The timeout risk may only happen when driver/device doesn't return
congestion feedback, meantime the host queue depth is big enough.

So far we don't see such issue on NVMe which hw queue depth is 1023, and
the hw queue count is often 32+, and not see such timeout report
when there are so many inflight IOs(32 * 1023) on single LUN.

Also megaraid sas's queue depth is much less than (32 * 1023), so it
seems much unlikely to happen.

Megaraid guys, could you clarify if it is one issue? Kashyap, Sumit
and Shivasharan?

Could you explain a bit how this patch changes the system beaviror? I
understand the EH just retries the incompleted requests, which total
number is just less than host queue depth.


Thanks,
Ming
