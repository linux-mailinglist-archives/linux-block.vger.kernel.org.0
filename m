That is why we add a Kconfig option and set it to N by default. And I 
suppose
with modern cpu, the cost with several more instructions would not be that
expensive even the option is enabled, just my $0.02.

I thought I am compare read a sys node + extra instructions in kernel with
launch a specific process for monitoring which need to occupy more
resources (memory) and context switch. And for biolatency, it calls the
bpf_ktime_get_ns to calculate latency for each IO which I assume the
ktime_get_ns will be triggered finally, and it is not cheap as you said.

Of course, we will keep the change in our own tree if it doesn't make sense
to others.

Thanks,
Guoqing
