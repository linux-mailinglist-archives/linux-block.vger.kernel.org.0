Thank you for the response and appreciate your help. Providing a bit of
details below.

The disk replication solution which I mentioned, hooks all the block i/o
operation using make_request_fn for specific device request queue and do
some massaging and then call the standard block operations.
The flow is something like below :

replication_func_init (struct block_device *bdev)
... orig_queue = bdev_get_queue(bdev)		// save the original state
... orig_request_fn = orig_queue->request_fn;
... orig_queue->make_request_fn = custom_function(say "replicate_request_func")


replicate_request_func(...) {
... does some driver specific massaging
... // calls original
    if (orig_queue->make_request_fn)
	orig_queue->make_request_fn(...)
    else
	blk_mq_make_request(...)
...

Now, the current implementation have make_request_fn moved to submit_bio, one
probable approach is to somehow, update the original submit_bio to custom
"replicate_submit_bio_func" and then handle the case likewise as done in
"replicate_request_func". But, "blk_mq_submit_bio" is not exported symbol..

Second, "submit_bio_noacct" is the next approach which we thought can be used
for submit the bio, but, for case where original submit_bio is NULL, we will
end calling recursively the new submit_bio, and panic. 

replicate_submit_bio_func
... does some driver specific massaging
... // calls exported symbol
   submit_bio_noacct
    __submit_bio_noacct(bio)
       __submit_bio
        disk->fops->submit_bio(bio) -> updated API
         replicate_submit_bio_func
           submit_bio_noacct

Hope, the provided information helps understanding the problem. If not, please
do let us know, we will try to provide more details accordingly.  Also, please
do provide your thoughts and suggestions how can we achieve the above kind of
functionality on latest kernel version.


Further, we were trying to understand the history over the removal of make_request_fn
in the queue within blk_mq_init_allocated_queue API, but didn't find much. Can you
please provide any information regarding the same. Also, is there a possibility of have
similar kind of implemenation for submit_bio ?

...
-	q->make_request_fn = blk_mq_make_request;
...
