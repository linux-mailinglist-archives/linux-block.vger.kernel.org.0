If something is said wrong, please correct me.

If sq->queue[] were only classfied SYNC and ASYNC, some things may 
become a little difficult to handle。As we put sync write and read 
together into SYNC queue, the two may influence each other.
Whit wbps=1M and rbps=100M configured, sync io likely be throtled while 
read ios after it may can be dispatched within the limit. In that case,
maybe we should scan the whole SYNC queue to check read io.

Thanks.
