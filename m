And that is my argument: what does this buy us?
Is is relevant (for blktrace) to have the SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE to be 
present in the logs?
 From my POV, blktrace is there to analyze I/O flow; device shutdown is 
not really relevant for that as the results of that operation depend on 
other factors which won't show up in blktrace at all.

So we're not losing much by (maybe) missing shutdown commands in 
blktrace; if needs be device shutdown can be traced by other means.

I'd rather keep the code simple, and not having an operation in the core 
block layer which requires quite some explanation.
_And_ relies on the current ordering; if things change here it'll be 
really hard to figure out if that workaround is still required or might 
be obsoleted by the change.

Cheers,

Hannes
