Yeah, I'd imagine so. Quite some drivers have 'interesting' ideas how
the firmware interface should look like.

But it also means that there is a very high likelyhood that these
drivers become inoperable under CPU hotplug.
Is there a way of disabling CPU hotplug when these drivers are in use?

It really shouldn't be an issue when the cpus are distributed 
'correctly' :-)
We have several possibilities:
-> #hwq > num_possible_cpus: easy, 1:1 mapping, no problem
-> num_online_cpu < #hwq < num_possible_cpus: Not as easy, but if we
    ensure that each online cpu is mapped to a different hwq we don't
    have a performance impact.
-> #hwq < num_online_cpu: If we ensure that a) the number of online cpus
    per hwq is (roughly) identical we won't have a performance impact.
    As a bonus we should strive to have the number of offline cpus
    distributed equally on each hwq.

Of course, that doesn't take into accound NUMA locality; with NUMA 
locality you would need to ensure to have at least one CPU per NUMA node
mapped to each hwq. Which actually would impose a lower limit on the
number (and granularity!) of hwqs (namely the number of NUMA nodes), but 
that's fair, I guess.

But this really can be delegated to later patches; initially we really
should identify which drivers might have issues with CPU hotplug,
and at the very least issue a warning for these drivers.

Oh, sure. No-one (except lpfc on Power) is testing CPU hotplug actively.

Yeah, I know. Sorry ...
