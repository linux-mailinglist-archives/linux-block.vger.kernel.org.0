That's a good question. Tracing shows that with dbench I'm seeing *lots*
(about 23000/s) blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queues() calls, mostly from
__blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched(). This drops to "only" about 2000 calls/s with
my patches applied.

So it means BFQ decided not to dispatch any request (e.g. because it is
idling for more IO from the same process) and that triggers that path in
__blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() that just queues the dispatch again. So blk-mq
ends up polling BFQ rather heavily for requests it doesn't want to give out
:). In this sense my patch just makes the real problem less severe.

I've noticed that if ->has_work() returned false, we would not end up
calling blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queues(). But for BFQ ->has_work() often
returns true because it has requests queued but ->dispatch_request()
doesn't dispatch anything because of other scheduling constraints. And so
we end up calling blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queues() because if we allocated
dispatch budget and didn't dispatch in the end, we could have blocked
dispatch from another hctx and so now need to rerun that hctx to dispatch
possibly queued requests.

I was thinking how we could possibly improve this. One obvious possibility
is to modify IO schedulers so that their ->has_work() does not return true
if they later decide not to dispatch anything. However this can happen both
to mq-deadline and BFQ and for either of them determining whether they will
dispatch a request or not is about as expensive as dispatching it. So it
doesn't seem very appealing for these IO schedulers to do the work twice or
to somehow cache the request found. What seems more workable would be for
blk_mq_put_dispatch_budget() to return whether rerunning the queue might be
needed or not (for SCSI, which is the only subsystem using budgeting, this
means returning whether we were currently at queue_depth) and use that
information in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched(). I'll experiment with a patch I
guess...
