Runtime power-management support in the block layer has somehow gotten
messed up in the past few years.  This area of code has been through a
lot of churn and it's not easy to track exactly when the bug addressed
here was introduced; it was present for a while, then fixed for a
while, and then it returned.

At any rate, the problem is that the block layer code thinks that it's
okay to issue a request with the BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT flag set at any
time, even when the queue and underlying device are runtime suspended.
This belief is wrong; the flag merely indicates that it's okay to
issue the request while the queue and device are in the process of
suspending or resuming.  When they are actually suspended, no requests
may be issued.

The symptom of this bug is that a runtime-suspended block device
doesn't resume as it should.  The request which should cause a runtime
resume instead gets issued directly, without resuming the device
first.  Of course the device can't handle it properly, the I/O
fails, and the device remains suspended.

The problem is fixed by checking that the queue's runtime-PM status
isn't RPM_SUSPENDED before allowing a request to be issued, and
queuing a runtime-resume request if it is.  In particular, the inline
blk_pm_request_resume() routine is renamed blk_pm_resume_queue() and
the code is unified by merging the surrounding checks into the
routine.  If the queue isn't set up for runtime PM, or there currently
is no restriction on allowed requests, the request is allowed.
Likewise if the BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT flag is set and the status isn't
RPM_SUSPENDED.  Otherwise a runtime resume is queued and the request
is blocked until conditions are more suitable.

---

The bug goes back way before 5.2, but other changes will prevent the
patch from applying directly to earlier kernels, so I'm limiting the 
@stable updates to 5.2 and after.
