Please see bio_iov_iter_get_pages():

  do {
  		...
      	if (is_bvec)
        	ret = __bio_iov_bvec_add_pages(bio, iter);
		...
   } while (!ret && iov_iter_count(iter) && !bio_full(bio, 0));


So all bvecs in bvec iter will be added to the bio, and it isn't
correct or efficient to just return 1.

thanks,
Ming
