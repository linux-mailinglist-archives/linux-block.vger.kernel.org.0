Yes I think Christoph was also pointed about the same but then assuming 
schedule/elevator update would be a rare operation it may not cause
a lot of contention. Having said that, I'm also fine creating another 
lock just to protect elevator changes and removing ->sysfs_lock from 
elevator code.

I don't know how this might cause ABBA deadlock. The proposal here's to 
use ->tag_list_lock (instead of ->sysfs_lock) while updating scheduler 
attribute from sysfs as well as while we update the elevator through 
__blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues().

In each code path (either from sysfs attribute update or from nr_hw_queues 
update), we first acquire ->tag_list_lock and then freeze-lock.

Do you see any code path where the above order might not be followed?  	

Thanks,
