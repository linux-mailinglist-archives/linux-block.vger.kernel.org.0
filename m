FWIW, the only other driver (gdth) which I see uses this API has this_id 
= -1 in the scsi host template.

note: If we want a fixed scsi_device per host, calling 
scsi_mq_setup_tags() -> scsi_get_host_dev() will fail as shost state is 
not running. Maybe we need to juggle some things there to provide a 
generic solution.
