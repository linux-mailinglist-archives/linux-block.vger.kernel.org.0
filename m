Ah, the patch I was CC'd on didn't contain this hunk! It only had the
change from cmpxchg() to the rcu_assign_pointer(), so I misunderstood
your intention, sorry!

In that case, I already proposed a patch to do that, and it also adds
a tiny bit of verbiage given we currently don't inform the user about
why this fails [0].

Let me know how you folks would like to proceed.
