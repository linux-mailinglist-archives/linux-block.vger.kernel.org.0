Hi Jens,

The above data structure is stored in NVDIMM as allocator's meta data.
It is designed to be directly accessed (in future update) as in-memory
object, but stored on non-volatiled memory like on-disk data structure.

To me, it is fine to use unsigned int/long/long long to define the
members, because nvdimm driver only works on 64bit platform. It is just
unclear to me which form/style I should use to define such data
structure. On one side they are stores as non-volatiled media, on other
side they are accessed directly as in-memory object...

For the above pointer, it is the same reason. In later version, such
object on NVDIMM will be referenced directly by an in-memory pointer
like we normally do for an in-memory object.

Therefore I do treat the data structure as in-memory object after the
DAX mapping accomplished. If not define it as an in-memory pointer, I
have to cast it into (void *) every time when I use it.

This is my mimicry from bcache code, which uses the least significant 8
bytes from the randomly generated UUID as a magic number. It is solid
and not changed during the whole life cycle for the nvm pages set.

Same reason for I use it as an in-memory pointer.

The above definition is just using all the structures as in-memory
object, the difference is just they are non-volatiled after reboot.

Thanks.
