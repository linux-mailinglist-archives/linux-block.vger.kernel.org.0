Admittedly, it's not pretty but we're abusing O_EXCL already for block
devices. We do have FMODE_* available. We could add
FMODE_WRITE_RESTRICTED because we have two bits left.

One other solution apart from FMODE_* I had come up with was even
nastier which would've been using the struct fd approach of using the
two available bits in the pointer. But that doesn't work because we have
stuff like dm that passes in strings which are byte aligned. And it's
arguably uglier.
