Excuse me?  I gave you quite a bit of early feedback!  I then went on
PTO for ~10 days, when I returned last week I had to deal with fixing
some 5.10 dm/block bio splitting regressions that only got resolved this
past Saturday in time for 5.10-rc7.

blk_interposer was/is on my short list to review closer (Hannes' version
that refined yours a bit more).. primarily to see if I could avoid the
extra clone and endio hooking.

The development window for 5.11 is past, so you pushing this without
using the approach discussed (in terms of DM) doesn't help your cause.

So you weren't willing to put the work in on something DM oriented
because you expected me to do the work for you?  And now you're looking
to side-step the consensus that was built because I didn't contribute
quick enough?  That's pretty messed up.

In the time-scale that is Linux kernel development.. you've really
jumped the gun and undercut my enthusiasm to work through the details.
I'd rather not read into your actions more than I already have here, but
I'm not liking what you've done here.  Kind of left in dismay with how
you decided to go down this path without a followup note to me or others
(that I'm aware of).

But I'm still willing to make blk_interposer work as we all discussed
(in terms of DM).
