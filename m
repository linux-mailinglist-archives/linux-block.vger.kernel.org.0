Umm.  The warning is as you said totally reasonable, and we fixed it as
soon as we got the report.  But it turns out my compiler certainly did
not report it (gcc version 10.2.1 20210110 (Debian 10.2.1-6)), Jens's
apparently also did not, and the regular build bot that is running on
tons of architectures did not report it until 9 days after the patch
was commited and pushed out, and until after Jens pulled it.

So while the complaint that we failed to get it into the same pull
request is entirely reasonable, the statement that it cannot have
gotten much testing at all is a bit ridiculous.  It's also not that
"I does not compile at all", but rather that -Werror makes a useful
but mostly harmless warning fatal.
