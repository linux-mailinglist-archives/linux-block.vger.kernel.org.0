Roughly yes, block devices have a pseudo filesystem, briefly
it registered the block device with device_add() so the
devtmpfs file is visible then but bdev_add() is not called yet
so for example, mounting like bdev_file_open_by_dev() cannot
find this and return ENXIO.

I think for most cases devices are added during boot so
it's hard to find, but in the stress hotplug cases, it
can be observed easily honestly.
