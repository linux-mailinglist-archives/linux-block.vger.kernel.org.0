In short: you don't.

Asynchronous initialization means that the device node /dev/bcache<N>
only shows up once registration is complete.

That's done by systemd, and typically nothing to worry about.
If we can stick with the udev rules and start initialization from an 
udev event everything should 'just work' (tm).

The proposed sequence of events is:

- backing device generates uevent
-> udev rule triggers bcache initialisation
    -> bcache driver starts initialistion workqueue
    -> bcache driver returns
-> udev event completed

bcache initialisation workqueue starts
    -> bcache driver registers backing device

- cache device generates uevent
-> udev rule triggers bcache initialisation
   -> bcache driver starts initialisation workqueue
   -> bcache driver returns

- bcache initialisation workqueue starts
-> bcache driver registers cache device
   -> bcache driver starts bcache initialisation
     -> bcache driver registers /dev/bcache<N>


With that the uevent handling / bcache userspace initialisation
just submits a workqueue element, and the uevent won't be held off
by an overly long initialisation process.

Cheers,

Hannes
