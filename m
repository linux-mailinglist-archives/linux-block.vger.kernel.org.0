A bit later than promised, I am clearly an optimist. In any case
here's the patch I had in mind to trigger the problem for other CMD6
operations. Please give at shot and see what happens.

Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: DEBUG: Force a long timeout for all CMD6

This is to test sdhci-omap, for example, to see what happens when using a
longer timeout. My guess is that it triggers __mmc_switch() to disable the
MMC_RSP_BUSY flag for the command. If so, it likely to make the host driver
to fail, in some way or the other.
