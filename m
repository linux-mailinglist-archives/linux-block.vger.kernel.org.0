The work item is a field of the zone write plug. Zone write plugs have
references to them as long as BIOs are in flight and and the zone is not full.
The zone write plug freeing through rcu is triggered by the last write to a zone
that makes the zone full. But the completion of this last write BIO may happen
right after the work issued the BIO with submit_bio_noacct_nocheck() and before
blk_zone_wplug_bio_work() returns, while the work item is still active.

The actual freeing of the plug happens only after the rcu grace period, and I
was not entirely sure if this is enough to guarantee that the work thread is
finished. But checking how the workqueue code processes the work item by calling
the work function (blk_zone_wplug_bio_work() in this case), there is no issue
because the work item (struct work_struct) is not touched once the work function
is called. So there are no issues/races with freeing the zone write plug. I was
overthinking this. My bad. We can drop this patch. Apologies for the noise.
