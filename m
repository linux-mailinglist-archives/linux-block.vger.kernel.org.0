Thanks, fixed. Please I stated:

	I've tested blktests with this for things which I can run virtually
	for a while now. More wider testig is welcomed.

Sure...

No, I was not aware this was a thing. I fixed all the stupid complaints
however I should note at least tests/srp/rc has existing complaints
before my changes. I won't address those.

I can't say I agree with the changes to remove checks for $?, but
whatever. Consinstancy is better than not having one. Perhaps we should
embrace this on fstests as well. Who knows how many crufty bugs lie
there.

No, I'll clarify to this:

# Tries to wait patiently to remove a module by ensuring first                  
# the refcnt is 0 and then trying to remove the module over and over            
# again within the time allowed

And the return value shoudl be $? not $1. I couldn't test srp so wanted
someone who would to help review, but sure, I should have caught this.

Thanks for the review, I'll post a v2.
