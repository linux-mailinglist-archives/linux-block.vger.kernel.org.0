It is CPU cold-plug, we suppose to support it.

The new added CPUs should be visible to hctx, since we spread queues
among all possible CPUs(), please see blk_mq_map_queues() and
irq_build_affinity_masks(), which is like static allocation on CPU
resources.

Otherwise, you might use an old kernel or there is bug somewhere.

As I shared in last email, there is one approach discussed, which seems
doable.

Thanks,
