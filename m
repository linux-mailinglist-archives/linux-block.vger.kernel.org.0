Also the weights and the I/O priorities of the queues inside the
groups needs to be controlled, unfortunately.

I think I see your point.  The problem is that these states are
dynamic.  So, if we suspend tracking all the above information while
more than one group is active, then we are with no state in case only
one group remains active.

Paolo
