In general no, there is no need to handle the request after calling end.
C drivers are not allowed to, because this transfers ownership of the
request back to the block layer. This patch series defer the transfer of
ownership to the point when the ARef<Request> refcount goes to zero, so
there should be no danger associated with touching the `Request` after
end.

Looking into the details now I see that calling `Request::end` more than
once will trigger UAF, because C code decrements the refcount on the
request. When we have `ARef<Request>` around, that is a problem. It
probably also messes with other things in C land. Good catch.

I did implement `Request::end` to consume the request at one point
before I fell back on reference counting. It works fine for simple
drivers. However, most drivers will need to use the block layer tag set
service, that allows conversion of an integer id to a request pointer.
The abstraction for this feature is not part of this patch set. But the
block layer manages a mapping of integer to request mapping, and drivers
typically use this to identify the request that corresponds to
completion messages that arrive from hardware. When drivers are able to
turn integers into requests like this, consuming the request in the call
to `end` makes little sense (because we can just construct more).

What I do now is issue the an `Option<ARef<Request>>` with
`bindings::req_ref_inc_not_zero(rq_ptr)`, to make sure that the request
is currently owned by the driver.

I guess we can check the absolute value of the refcount, and only issue
a request handle if the count matches what we expect. Then we can be certain
that the handle is unique, and we can require transfer of ownership of
the handle to `Request::end` to make sure it can never be called more
than once.

Another option is to error out in `Request::end` if the
refcount is not what we expect.

That would be similar to calling end twice.

I see, I will update the comment.
