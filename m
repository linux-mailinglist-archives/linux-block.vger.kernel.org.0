We may not have timed out already. If the tag_set.timeout=0, then the
block timer will fire every 30 seconds. This could be the first time the
timer has fired. If it has fired multiple times already then it still
would not have been requeued because the num_connections=1 code just
does a BLK_EH_RESET_TIMER when timeout=0 and does not have support for
detecting reconnects.

In this second patch if timeout=0 and num_connections=1 we restart the
command when the command timer fires and we detect a new connection
(nsock->cookie has incremented).

I was saying in the last patch, maybe waiting for reconnect is wrong.
Does a cmd timeout=0 mean to wait for a reconnect or in this patch
should we do:

1. if timeout=0, num_connections=1, and the cmd timer fires and the
conneciton is marked dead then requeue the command.
2. we then rely on the dead_conn_timeout code to decide how long to wait
for a reconnect.
