The triviality to adjust alignment in firmware has nothing to do with
some users' desire to not see gaps in LBA space.

All zone block devices through the linux kernel use a common abstraction
interface. Users expect you can swap out one zone device for another and all
their previously used features will continue to work. That does not necessarily
hold with relaxing the long existing zone alignment. Fragmenting uses harms
adoption, so this discussion seems appropriate.
