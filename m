Seems to be cropping up everywhere now; anyway, I do agree with Bart here.
For the hot path (typically when looking up the associated command from 
within the interrupt routine) we really should not add any further code 
to not slow down processing.
Additionally, this is typically a firmware response so we can be 
reasonably certain that this is a response to valid command, so in 
nearly all cases the bit will be set.
(Pathological cases like spoofed response frames aside).

However, there another use case where blk_mq_tag_to_rq() is used, and 
that is for traversing outstanding commands eg during a device reset.
There we _have_ to ensure that the request is valid lest we run into
uninitialized values.

So I would advocate to have a slow path variant here which would 
validate the bitmap before trying to access the request.

Or, really, converting those drivers to use blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter().

Cheers,

Hannes
