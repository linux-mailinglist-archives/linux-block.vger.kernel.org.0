It's just pointless to grab double references, and counter productive
too.

I'd be fine with that, but it's a bit of a chicken and egg situation as
we don't know. I guess we could move the plugged request check earlier,
and just bypass merging there. Though that makes it a special case
thing, and it's generally useful now. Not sure that would be a good
idea.

Which parameters are you worried about in submit_bio_checks()? I don't
immediately see anything that would make me worry about it.

It's just for avoiding a pointless call into bio_queue_enter(), which
isn't needed it blk_try_enter_queue() is successful. The latter is short
and small and can be inlined, while bio_queue_enter() is a lot bigger.
