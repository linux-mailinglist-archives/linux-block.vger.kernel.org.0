I think you are! The NOP case is just a sample way of exercising the
CQE32 support, with extra1+2 being what is passed back in the bigger
CQE. The NOP command exists purely to test things, and the CQE32 support
there is a bit forced because NOP just always completes with '0' in the
normal res field.

We can obviously dump this as it isn't integral to anything, and
honestly now that the NVMe is wired up, there's no great need to have a
separate test for it. But it doesn't really hurt and there are already
regression tests for it.
