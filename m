io_uring(polling) workloads often cares latency, so big IO request
isn't involved usually, I guess. Then bio_split() is seldom called in
dm_split_and_process_bio(), such as if 4k random IO is run on dm-linear
or dm-stripe via io_uring, bio_split() won't be run into.

Single list is enough here, and efficient than hlist, just need
a little care to delete element from the list since linux kernel doesn't
have generic single list implementation.

Yeah, that patch also needs more test.
