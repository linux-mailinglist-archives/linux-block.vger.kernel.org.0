Taking a look at the mddev code this commit just seems to increase the
race window of hitting horrible life time problems in md, but I'll also
try to reproduce and verify it myself.

Take a look at how md searches for a duplicate name in md_alloc,
mddev_alloc_unit and mddev_find_locked based on the all_mddevs list,
and how the mddev gets dropped from all_mddevs very early and long
before the gendisk is gone in mddev_put.  I think what needs to be
done is to implement a free_disk method and drop the mddev (and free it)
from that.  But given how much intricate mess is based on all_mddevs
we'll have to be very careful about that.
