The parted command, used to list the partitions, will open the disk in RW mode which results in systemd-udevd re-reading the partitions. This will trigger the rescan partitions which will also delete and re-add the partitions. So, both iscsi logout processing and the parted (through systemd-udevd) will be involved in add/delete of partitions. In our case, the following sequence of operations happened (the iscsi device is /dev/sdb with partition sdb1):

OK, I guess I understood your issue now, what you want is to not allow
to add partitions since step 1, so can you remove disk just at the
beginning of 2) if it is possible? then step 1) isn't needed any more

For your issue, my patch of 'not drop partitions if partition table
isn't changed' can't fix your issue completely since new real partition
still may come from parted during the series.


Thanks,
Ming
