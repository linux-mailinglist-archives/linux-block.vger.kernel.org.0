Can you explain a bit "synchronous" here?

In patch 4, two ublk uring_cmd(UBLK_U_IO_REGISTER_IO_BUF/UBLK_U_IO_UNREGISTER_IO_BUF)
are added, and their handlers are called from uring_cmd's ->issue().

The buffer is registered in ->issue() of UBLK_U_IO_REGISTER_IO_BUF,
and it isn't done yet when calling ->prep() of read_fixed/write_fixed,
in which buffer is looked up in ->prep().

UBLK_U_IO_UNREGISTER_IO_BUF tells ublk that the buffer isn't used any
more, but it is being used by the async read/write.

It might work, but looks a bit fragile, such as:

One buggy application may panic kernel if the IO command is completed
before read/write is done.

OK.

Here it depends on if LINK between buffer register and read/write are
required. If it is required, multiple OPs consuming the buffer have to
be linked one by one, then they can't be issue concurrently.
