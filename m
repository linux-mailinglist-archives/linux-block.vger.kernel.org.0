It would be great if you read though the original patch
description. Since v2 had a little change to consider
mutiple maps among parent and child, it would introduce a little
mistmatch with the description but it's still quite good to explain
current problem.

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220105233440.63361-1-mfo@canonical.com/T/#u

Problem is MADV_FREEed anonymous memory is supposed to work based on
dirtiness came from the user process's page table bit or PageDirty.
Since VM can't see the dirty, it just discards the anonymous memory
instead of swappoing out. Thus, the dirtiness is key to work correctly.

However, DIO didn't make the page Dirty yet until IO is completed
and at the same time, the store operation didn't go though via
user process's page table regardless of DMA or other way.
It makes VM could decide just drop the page since it didn't see
any dirtiness from the page. So it turns out enduser would be
surprised because the read syscall with DIO was completed but
the data was zero rather than latest uptodate data.

To prevent the problem, the patch suggested to compare page_mapcount
with page_count since it expects any additional reference of the page
means someone is doing accessing the memory so in this case, not
discarding the page. However, Yu pointed out page_count and
page_mapcount could be reordered in copy_page_range, for example.
So I am looking for the solution(one would be adding memory barrier
right before page_dup_rmap but I'd like to avoid it if we have
other idea). And then man page says forking under going DIO would
be already prohibited so the concern raised would be void, IIUC.

Hope this helps your understanding.
Thanks!
