Arg ! dm-error is used in xfstests so we need it (for btrfs at least since btrfs
supports zoned devices, and soon xfs as well). So I guess we should disallow
switching tables when the new table changes something to the zone configuration
(grow, shrink, zone size, zoned/non-zoned). dm-error does not change anything,
so we should still be able to allow it.
