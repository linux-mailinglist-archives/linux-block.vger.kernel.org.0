Oh, I agree with that. It's not hard at all; I'm aware of two
implementations of doing that (I've written an nbd initramfs hook for
Debian's initramfs infrastructure, and others have done it for dracut).
I'm assuming that buildroot will have an initramfs framework too (and if
it doesn't, then that probably just means someone should write it), and
then writing an nbd initramfs hook for that framework should be
reasonably easy.

Also, the proposed initramfs configuration protocol uses the same
"nbdroot" name as my Debian initramfs hooks, but in an incompatible way.
I'd really like to see that be done differently, before/if it's accepted
at all ;-)
