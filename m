Data in bios can't be modified in-place, as submitters of writes (e.g.,
filesystems) expect that their data buffers aren't modified.  To modify the data
you'd need to allocate a new bio with new pages and submit that instead.  See
dm-crypt for an example of a device-mapper target which does this.

What sort of device-mapper target are you trying to implement, anyway?  If
you're trying to do encryption, dm-crypt already solves that problem.
