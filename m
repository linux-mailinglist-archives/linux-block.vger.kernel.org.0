Then the issue isn't related with zone append command only. Just wondering how this
special write block size alignment is enhanced in sequential zones. So far, write
from FS or raw block size is only logical block size aligned.

That is because the default magic number of BLK_SAFE_MAX_SECTORS.

Maybe we can update it once the logical block size is available, such
as:
