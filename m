Ok, but to be fair, trying to add the crazy hacks that were being
proposed to sysfs for something that is obviously not a code path that
can be taken by a normal user or operation is just not going to fly.

Removing a module from a system has always been "let's try it and see!"
type of operation for a very long time.  While we try our best, doing
horrible hacks for this rare type of thing are generally not considered
a good idea which is why I said that.
