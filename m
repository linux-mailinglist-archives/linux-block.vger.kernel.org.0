No matter the loop, the bios are actually submitted to the
current->bio_list via submit_bio_noacct() or submit_bio().
'grep -r submit_bio drivers/md' will show you the point.

Also it is a bug if one underlying bio is submitted without being checked.

You can observe it by the following bpftrace when you run io_uring on dm
disk:

#include <linux/blkdev.h>

kprobe:blk_mq_submit_bio
/strncmp(((struct bio *)arg0)->bi_bdev->bd_disk->disk_name, "nvme", 4) == 0/
{
	$b = (struct bio *)arg0;
	$hipri = $b->bi_opf & (1 << __REQ_HIPRI);

	printf("%s %d: %s %lu %lu high prio %d\n", comm, tid, $b->bi_bdev->bd_disk->disk_name,
		$b->bi_iter.bi_sector, $b->bi_iter.bi_size, $hipri);
}

Even though these bios are queued, blk_poll() still can handle them
easily by just ignoring queues which aren't POLL_TYPE. However, I still
think their HIPRI will be cleared.
