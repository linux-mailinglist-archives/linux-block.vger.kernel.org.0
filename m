I need a little help here.  Since high-priority I/O is immediately
injected, I wonder why it does not receive all the bandwidth it
demands.  Maybe, from your analysis, you have an answer.  Perhaps it
happens because:
1) high-priority I/O is FIFO-queued with lower-priority I/O in the
   dispatch list?
or
2) immediate injection prevents idling from being performed in favor
   of high-priority I/O?

Not sure that accounting would help high-priority I/O in your scenario.

For the pattern to be similar, I guess that, when new high-priority
I/O arrives, this I/O should preempt lower-priority I/O.
Unfortunately, this is not always the case, depending on other
parameters.  Waker/wakee I/O is guaranteed to be injected only when the
in-service queue has no I/O.

At any rate, probably we can solve this puzzle by just analyzing a
trace in which you detect a loss of throughput without 7cc4ffc55564.
The best case would be one with the minimum possible number of
threads, to get a simpler trace.

I hope my considerations above help a little bit.
