Long story short we have 3 new PCI Gen 4 SSD - NVMe drives from 
Gigabyte. But actually, Gigabyte is just putting their name on it as I 
believe it is actually from "Phison".

Here is the website where you can see the new drives -- 
https://www.gigabyte.com/Solid-State-Drive/Gen-4

I have opened a ticket with Gigabyte, and have inquired about any 
available firmware updates. It will take 3-5 days to hear back from 
them, but will report back the finding.

Thank you for taking a look at the tracing file, and hopefully that 
gives enough insight as to what might be happening.

Best Regards,

David
