Okay, I see. I think this needs a new nvme AER notice as Martin
suggested. The desired host behavior is simiilar to what we do with a
"firmware activation notice" where we temporarily quiesce new requests
and reset IO timeouts for previously dispatched requests. Perhaps tie
this to the CSTS.PP register as well.
