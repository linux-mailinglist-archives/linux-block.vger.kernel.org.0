Great, thanks for confirming!

Do you know if that is because of how the driver manages R1B/R1 or
because of a limitation in the HW?

Okay, good.

Right, it probably works for most cases. In any case, this was broken
even before my three patches that screwed things up.

BTW, what HW busy time out will you be using for sdhci omap if
cmd->busy_timeout exceeds it? Is it 2581ms for all sdhci-omap
instances or does it differ depending on platform?

Anyway, in this phase, it sounds like we should move forward with a
patch setting max_busy_timeout to zero for sdhci omap, as that
restores things to the earlier behavior. Would you mind posting a
patch, or do you want me to manage it?

Kind regards
Uffe
