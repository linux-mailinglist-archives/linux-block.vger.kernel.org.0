I think Martin might be considering kernel modules as apps since they can
access the integrity payload no problem. I know of at least one out-of-tree
module (ex: OpenCAS) that utilizes the apptag (not that upstream necessarily
should care about such modules..).

Outside that, passthrough ioctls and io_uring_cmd can access the fields. I
don't think those interfaces apply to what you're changing, though, since these
bypass the submit_bio() interface.

If we're considering only in-tree usage, I think you're correct.

If we're talking about any of the nvme passthrough interfaces, which format
will the user space need to construct its command for? This seems confusing
since userspace doesn't have direct control over which path the command will be
dispatched on, so it won't know which format it needs to cater to, nor will it
have deterministic behavior.
