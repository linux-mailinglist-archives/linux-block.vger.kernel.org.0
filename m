Indeed. And getting rid of any ordering ops like barriers greatly
simplified things and fixed a number of issued related to that.

That's a given.

I'm not talking about a new block layer at all, ordered devices are not
nearly important enough to warrant that kind of attention. Nor would it
be a good solution even if they were. I'm merely saying that I'm getting
more and more disgruntled with the direction that is being taken to
cater to these kinds of devices, and perhaps a much better idea is to
contain that complexity in a separate scheduler (be it stacked or not).
Because I'm really not thrilled to see the addition of various "is this
device ordered" all over the place, and now we are getting "is this
device ordered AND pipelined". Do you see what I mean? It's making
things _worse_, not better, and we really should be making it better
rather than pile more stuff on top of it.
