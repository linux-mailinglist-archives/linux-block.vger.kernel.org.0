Please explain how this is an nvme-multipath issue?

Not sure I understand..
requests should failover for path related errors,
what queue_rq errors are expected to be failed over from your
perspective?

What is the specific error the driver sees?

Well, certainly this one-shot always return 0 and complete the command
with HOST_PATH error is not a good approach IMO
