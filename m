Here the 'gone' may be just in logical/soft viewpoint, such as, one disk
is removed by sysfs, and the driver still may send sync cache command
to make sure the cache inside drive is flushed, such as scsi's
SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE.

Such as the above example, the command of SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE can't be
observed in blktrace any more.
