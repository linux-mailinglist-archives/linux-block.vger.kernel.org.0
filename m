It was reported from one RH customer, and I am also hit once
when running dbench on loop(bfq) over scsi_debug in my routine test.

David figured out the idea, and we discussed other solutions too, but
turns out others can't work, and the above (extreme)example seems easier
to follow, from me.

Per David's early analysis, it should be easier to trigger since commit
26edb30dd1c0 ("sbitmap: Try each queue to wake up at least one waiter")
because 'wake_index' isn't updated before calling wake_up_nr(), then
multiple completion batch may only wakeup one same wait queue, meantime
multiple sleepers are added to same wait queue.


Thanks, 
Ming
