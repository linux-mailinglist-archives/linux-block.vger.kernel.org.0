Thanks for working on this!  I noticed the problem behaviour using the 
Fedora 29 kernel [1].  I wasn't sure how it could be fixed.  Now I found 
this patch series, but I still have some questions :-).

[1] 
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/517132/dd-is-running-at-full-speed-but-i-only-see-20-disk-utilization-why

With these patches, `atopsar -d 2` shows about 100% "busy" when running 
a simple `dd` command, instead of 20 or 35%.  So that looked promising.

I saw some samples showing 112, 113, and 114% utilization. 
Unfortunately I'm not sure exactly how to reproduce that.  I think it 
happened during filesystem buffered writes (i.e. `dd` without 
`oflag=direct`), with the IO scheduler set to "none", on my SATA HDD.

Getting some "101% busy" samples seemed fairly easy to trigger, but I am 
not sure whether that is just a rounding error in `atopsar` :-(.


Q1)

 > Fix for slow requests is simple: at the end of request add
 > count of jiffies passed since last update.

Even considering the simple case of a single CPU, the approximation may 
be "less accurate" when requests complete out of order.  Is that right?

  t        1      10     20   30
  io1      start              end
  io2             start  end
  io_ticks 1      2      11   21

            ^^^^^^
               \
                 9 ticks not accounted as "busy"


At least, I found something fun happens if I run `dd if=/dev/urandom 
of=~/t bs=1M oflag=direct` at the same time as `dd if=/dev/sda 
of=/dev/null bs=1M oflag=direct` .  With scheduler=none, it reduces 
"busy" from 100%, down to 97%.  With scheduler=mq-deadline, it reduces 
"busy" from 100% to 60% :-).  Even though the system "iowait" is about 
100% (equivalent to one CPU).

(Environment: My /dev/sda max read speed is about 150MB/s.  My 
/dev/urandom read speed is about 140 MB/s.  I have 4 logical CPUs).

It feels like it should be possible to improve io_ticks, by basically 
changing the condition in your fix, from (end==true), to (inflight>0). 
Would that make sense?


Q2) But what most confuses me, is that I think `io_ticks` is defined as 
a per-cpu field.  And the per-cpu fields are summed into one value, 
which is reported to userspace.

I have tried playing with a couple `dd iflag=direct` readers, using 
`taskset` to pin them to different CPUs, but I only got 98-102% "busy". 
It did not rise to 200% :-).

i) Is it possible to see 200% "busy", due to per-cpu ioticks?

ii) If so, then can per-cpu ioticks also cause us to see 100% "busy", 
when IO's were only inflight for 50% of the time (but on two different 
CPUs)?

     If it is possible to trigger both of these cases, this metric seems 
very difficult to trust and use in any reliable way.  It seems 
preferable to disable it altogether and force people to use more 
trustworthy metrics.  E.g. system-wide "iowait", and iostat field 11 
"weighted # of milliseconds spent doing I/Os" which `iostat` uses to 
show "average queue length".

     Or the "special pleading" approach?  Should ioticks accounted at 
the level of the hardware queue, and be disabled if the device has is 
using more than one hardware queue?


Q3) In case I am mistaken in some way, and Q2 is not an issue at all:

I still think reporting over 100% utilization is something new.  At 
least the comments I see were removed in the "Fixes" commit seem to 
agree.  That one error of 14% ("114% busy") that I saw, seems fairly big 
:-).

I wonder if we can better explain how much of a rough approximation this 
metric is now, e.g. in Documentation/iostats.txt ?

So far I don't know what the real description and limitations would be...

I think it would be understandable e.g. if we were able to say "busy%" 
should show around 100% when the device is used around 100% of the time, 
and definitely 0% when it is idle, but is probably not as accurate as 
"iowait". ("iowait" reported by the CPU scheduler.  Not to say these are 
the same or equivalent.  And I understand "iowait" is another ball of 
approximations and confusion.)

Alan
