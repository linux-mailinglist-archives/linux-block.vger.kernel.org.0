As mentioned in the original message as below, administrators _can_ avoid this
problem, but finding the optimal configuration is hard, especially if the
number of the guests is large.

	System administrators can avoid such problematic situations by limiting
	the maximum number of devices each guest can attach.  However, finding
	the optimal limit is not so easy.  Improper set of the limit can
	results in the memory pressure or a resource underutilization.
