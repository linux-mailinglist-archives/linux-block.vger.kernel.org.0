Yes, it has a lot of buggy users.

It should only be used by kthtreads which do allow_signal(), and imo
even in this case kernel_dequeue_signal() makes more sense.

I am looking at 2 first users reported by git-grep.

arch/arm/common/bL_switcher.c:bL_switcher_thread(). Why does it do
flush_signals() ? signal_pending() must not be possible. It seems that
people think that wait_event_interruptible() or even schedule() in
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state can lead to a pending signal but this is not
true. Of course, I could miss allow_signal() in bL_switch_to() paths...

drivers/block/drbd/. I know nothing about this code, but it seems that
flush_signals() can be called by the userspace process. This should be
forbidden.

IOW, I mostly agree with

	- * Flush all pending signals for this kthread.
	+ * Flush all pending signals for this kthread. Please note that this interface
	+ * shouldn't be used and in fact it is DEPRECATED.
	+ * Existing users should be double checked because most of them are likely
	+ * obsolete. Kernel threads are not on the receiving end of signal delivery
	+ * unless they explicitly request that by allow_signal() and in that case
	+ * flush_signals is almost always a bug because signal should be processed
	+ * by kernel_dequeue_signal rather than dropping them on the floor.

you wrote in your previous email, but "DEPRECATED" and "almost always a bug"
looks a bit too strong to me.

I would like to add WARN_ON(!PF_KTHREAD) into flush_signals() and let people
fix their code ;)

Oleg.
