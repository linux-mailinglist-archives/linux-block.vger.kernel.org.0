Aren't NVMe devices expected to set the NOIOB parameter to avoid that 
NVMe commands straddle boundaries that incur a performance penalty? From 
the NVMe spec: "Namespace Optimal IO Boundary (NOIOB): This field 
indicates the optimal IO boundary for this namespace. This field is 
specified in logical blocks. The host should construct read and write 
commands that do not cross the IO boundary to achieve optimal 
performance. A value of 0h indicates that no optimal IO boundary is 
reported."

Thanks,

Bart.
