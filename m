Hi Damien,

Restricting the number of active zones in the I/O scheduler (patch 
11/11) requires some knowledge of the zone condition.

According to ZBC-2, for sequential write preferred zones the additional 
sense code ZONE TRANSITION TO FULL must be reported if the zone 
condition changes from not full into full. There is no such requirement 
for sequential write required zones. Additionally, I'm not aware of any 
reporting mechanism in the NVMe specification for changes in the zone 
condition.

The overhead of submitting a REPORT ZONES command after every I/O 
completion would be unacceptable.

Is there any other solution for tracking the zone condition other than 
comparing the LBA at which a WRITE command finished with the zone capacity?

Did I perhaps overlook something?

Thanks,

Bart.
