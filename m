Hello Shinichiro,

block/004 only sends 1564 sync randwrite, and seems 130s has been slow
enough.

There are two related effect in that commit for your issue:

1) 'at_head' is applied in blk_mq_sched_insert_request() for flush
request

2) all IO is added back to tail of hctx->dispatch after .queue_rq()
returns STS_RESOURCE

Seems it is more related with 2) given you can't reproduce the issue on 
SAS.

So please test the following two patches, and see which one makes a
difference for you.

BTW, both two looks not reasonable, just for narrowing down the issue.

1) patch 1
