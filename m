While I think the general idea(using file-overwrite-rates as a
parameter when doing data placement) could be useful, it could not
replace the user space hinting we already have.

Applications(e.g. RocksDB) doing sequential writes to files that are
immutable until deleted(no overwrites) would not benefit. We need user
space help to estimate data lifetime for those workloads and the
relative write lifetime hints are useful for that.

So what I am asking myself is if this framework is added, who would
benefit? Without any benchmark results it's a bit hard to tell :)

Also, is there a good reason for only supporting buffered io? Direct
IO could benefit in the same way, right?

Thanks,
Hans
