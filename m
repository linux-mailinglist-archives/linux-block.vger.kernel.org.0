DM already calls bio split to limits at the top of its submission path. Not for
all BIOs though.

I encourage you to look at the DM code more closely to understand the issue
here. What is happening is that DM in general does *NOT* split write BIOs. But
a DM target driver is free to do so using dm_accept_partial_bio() and that will
cause the reminder of a BIO to be issued again but *NOT* necessarily from the
same context. Because of zone write plugging, this may happen from the zone
write plug BIO work, thus causing going through the queue enter which can
deadlock with freeze when a BIO for the same zone is already plugged.

Zone write plugging heavily relies on the fact that once plugged, BIOs should
*NOT* be split again, as otherwise we can deadlock. DM dm_accept_partial_bio()
breaks that contract.

I do not like this. This is playing weird games with the queue enter/exit which
are very hard to understand. And I think Jens will not accept this as he does
not want to see zone stuff all over the place (and I agree).

For a nicer solution, which is mostly DM-based, combine what I sent you to
force write BIOs to be split early for zoned DM devices together with the patch
[1], which I sent already but needs more work. This combination was tested by
Shin'ichiro and he could not reproduce the hang with both patches applied.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/dm-devel/20250611011340.92226-1-dlemoal@kernel.org/

As far as I can tell, dm-crypt is the only DM target driver supporting zones
that splits write operations "under the hood". But I will check again.
