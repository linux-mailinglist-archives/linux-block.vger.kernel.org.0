Not sure this helps.  I think we need to fix this proper and in the
block layer.  The long term fix is to stop messing with i_blksize
at all, but that is going to take very long.

I think for now the only thing we can do is to set a flag in the
gendisk when the block size changes and then reject all I/O until
the next first open that sets the blocksize.
