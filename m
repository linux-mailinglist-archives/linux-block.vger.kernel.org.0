That was not the intent, but rather to state that REQ_FUA isn't the
only thing a filesystem can rely on, there are other things too. If
it's striving towards being more tolerant to sudden power failures, I
mean.

Anyway, thanks for your advice, I will drop these parts from the
commit message to make sure it doesn't cause confusion.

Of course, then I get your point!

I think the confusing part here is that the internals of the eMMC
treats a "reliable write" as a cache flush too. At least this is the
case for earlier eMMC devices, where the write-cache couldn't be
explicitly controlled by the host.

Kind regards
