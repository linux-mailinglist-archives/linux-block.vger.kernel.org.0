Hi Uffe

Will go with 2nd option and will send patches out when ready.

BTW, Tegra host also supports SDHCI_QUIRK_DATA_TIMEOUT_USES_SDCLK for 
data timeout based on host clock when using finite mode (HW busy 
detection based on DATA TIMEOUT count value when cmd operation timeout 
is < 11s for tegra host).

So, looks like we cant set host max_busy_timeout to 0 for Tegra host to 
force R1B during SWITCH and SLEEP_AWAKE.

So, was thinking to introduce host capability MMC_CAP2_LONG_WAIT_HW_BUSY 
which can be used for hosts supporting long or infinite HW busy wait 
detection and will update mmc and mmc_ops drivers to not allow convert 
R1B to R1B for hosts with this capability during SLEEP_AWAKE and SWITCH.

Thanks
