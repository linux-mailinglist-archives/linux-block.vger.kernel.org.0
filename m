As you well know: dm-multipath was first engineered to handle SCSI, and
it was too tightly coupled at the start, but the scsi_dh interface
provided sorely missing abstraction. With NVMe, dm-multipath was
further enhanced to not do work only needed for SCSI.

Seems SUSE has forgotten that dm-multipath has taken strides to properly
abstract away SCSI specific details, at least this patchset forgot it
(because proper layering/abstraction is too hard? that mantra is what
gave native NVMe multipath life BTW):
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/dm-devel/list/?series=475271

Long story short, there is utility in dm-multipath being transport
agnostic with specialized protocol specific bits properly abstracted.

If you or others don't care about any of that anymore, that's fine! But
it doesn't mean others don't. Thankfully both can exist perfectly fine,
sadly that clearly isn't possible without absurd tribal fighting (at
least in the context of NVMe).

And to be clear Hannes: your quick review of this patchset couldn't have
been less helpful or informed. Yet it enabled NVMe maintainers to ignore
technical review (you gave them cover).

The lack of proper technical review of this patchset was astonishing but
hch's dysfunctional attack that took its place really _should_ concern
others. Seems it doesn't, must be nice to not have a dog in the fight
other than philosophical ideals that enable turning a blind eye.

Sounds like you either have very few customers and/or they don't use
layers that were engineered with dm-multipath being an integral layer
in the IO stack. That's fine, but that doesn't prove anything other
than your limited experience.

Nothing to be sorry about, good on you and the others at SUSE
engineering for improving native NVMe multipathing. Red Hat supports it
too, so your and others' efforts are appreciated there.
