This behavior is introduced int the following commit, and I guess it is
because we support multi-range discard request, maybe Jens can explain more.

    block: don't honor chunk sizes for data-less IO

    We don't need to honor chunk sizes for IO that doesn't carry any
    data.

block layer doesn't have late bio splitting, and bio is only splitted
via __blk_queue_split() before allocating request.

blk_rq_get_max_sectors() is only called by rq merge code, actually it
should have been defined in block/blk.h instead of public header.

Not sure I understand your question. 'chunk_sectors' is firstly used
during bio split(get_max_io_size() from blk_bio_segment_split()),

blk_rq_get_max_sectors() is called when one bio or rq can be merged to
current request, and we have already considered all kinds of queue limits
when doing bio splitting, so not necessary to consider it again here during
merging rq.
