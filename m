OK. But your patch will still endup with IO priorities being ignored for
legitimate use cases that do not lead to mixed-priorities. E.g. applications
using directly the raw device and doing writes to a zone without mixing
priorities, either with AIO, ionice or cgroups.

The issue is when a user mixes different IO priorities for writes to the same
zone, and as I said before, since doing that is nonsensical, getting the IOs to
fail is fine by me. The user will then be aware that this should not be done.

f2fs has a problem with that though as that leads to write errors and FS going
read-only (I guess). btrfs will not have this issue because it uses zone append.
Need to check dm-zoned as their may be an issue there.

So what about what I proposed in an earlier email: introduce a bio flag "ignore
ioprio" that causes bio_set_ioprio() to not set any IO priority and have f2fs
set that flag for any zone write BIO it issues ? That will solve your f2fs issue
without messing up good use cases.
