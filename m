I don't think that ZNS supersedes OCSSD. OCSSDs provide much more
flexibility and device control and remain valuable for academia. For
us, PBLK is the most accurate "SSD Emulator" out there that, as
another benefit, enables real-time performance measurements.
That being said, I understand that this may not be a good enough
reason to keep it around, but I wouldn't mind if it stayed for another
while.
