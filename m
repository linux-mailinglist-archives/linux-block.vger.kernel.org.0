Yeah, that's what I was suggesting as well [1] - especially since we
already have bdi->name with a dubious value (but looking into it now, we
would need a separate dev_name field since bdi->name is visible in sysfs so
we cannot change that). But Yufen explained to me that this could result in
bogus name being reported when bdi gets re-registered. Not sure if that's
serious enough but it could happen...
