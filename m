This patch adds two hash maps, one keyed by integers, the other by
pointers, and also a priority heap. The integer map is used for locking of
logical and physical addresses. The pointer map is used for managing
concurrent writes of the same data, ensuring that those writes are
deduplicated. The priority heap is used to minimize the search time for
free blocks.

+ * DOC:
+ *
+ * Hash table implementation of a map from integers to pointers, implemented using the Hopscotch
+ * Hashing algorithm by Herlihy, Shavit, and Tzafrir (see
+ * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_hashing). This implementation does not contain any of the
+ * locking/concurrency features of the algorithm, just the collision resolution scheme.
+ *
+ * Hopscotch Hashing is based on hashing with open addressing and linear probing. All the entries
+ * are stored in a fixed array of buckets, with no dynamic allocation for collisions. Unlike linear
+ * probing, all the entries that hash to a given bucket are stored within a fixed neighborhood
+ * starting at that bucket. Chaining is effectively represented as a bit vector relative to each
+ * bucket instead of as pointers or explicit offsets.
+ *
+ * When an empty bucket cannot be found within a given neighborhood, subsequent neighborhoods are
+ * searched, and one or more entries will "hop" into those neighborhoods. When this process works,
+ * an empty bucket will move into the desired neighborhood, allowing the entry to be added. When
+ * that process fails (typically when the buckets are around 90% full), the table must be resized
+ * and the all entries rehashed and added to the expanded table.
+ *
+ * Unlike linear probing, the number of buckets that must be searched in the worst case has a fixed
+ * upper bound (the size of the neighborhood). Those entries occupy a small number of memory cache
+ * lines, leading to improved use of the cache (fewer misses on both successful and unsuccessful
+ * searches). Hopscotch hashing outperforms linear probing at much higher load factors, so even
+ * with the increased memory burden for maintaining the hop vectors, less memory is needed to
+ * achieve that performance. Hopscotch is also immune to "contamination" from deleting entries
+ * since entries are genuinely removed instead of being replaced by a placeholder.
+ *
+ * The published description of the algorithm used a bit vector, but the paper alludes to an offset
+ * scheme which is used by this implementation. Since the entries in the neighborhood are within N
+ * entries of the hash bucket at the start of the neighborhood, a pair of small offset fields each
+ * log2(N) bits wide is all that's needed to maintain the hops as a linked list. In order to encode
+ * "no next hop" (i.e. NULL) as the natural initial value of zero, the offsets are biased by one
+ * (i.e. 0 => NULL, 1 => offset=0, 2 => offset=1, etc.) We can represent neighborhoods of up to 255
+ * entries with just 8+8=16 bits per entry. The hop list is sorted by hop offset so the first entry
+ * in the list is always the bucket closest to the start of the neighborhood.
+ *
+ * While individual accesses tend to be very fast, the table resize operations are very, very
+ * expensive. If an upper bound on the latency of adding an entry to the table is needed, we either
+ * need to ensure the table is pre-sized to be large enough so no resize is ever needed, or we'll
+ * need to develop an approach to incrementally resize the table.

+/**
+ * DOC:
+ *
+ * Hash table implementation of a map from integers to pointers, implemented using the Hopscotch
+ * Hashing algorithm by Herlihy, Shavit, and Tzafrir (see
+ * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_hashing). This implementation does not contain any of the
+ * locking/concurrency features of the algorithm, just the collision resolution scheme.
+ *
+ * Hopscotch Hashing is based on hashing with open addressing and linear probing. All the entries
+ * are stored in a fixed array of buckets, with no dynamic allocation for collisions. Unlike linear
+ * probing, all the entries that hash to a given bucket are stored within a fixed neighborhood
+ * starting at that bucket. Chaining is effectively represented as a bit vector relative to each
+ * bucket instead of as pointers or explicit offsets.
+ *
+ * When an empty bucket cannot be found within a given neighborhood, subsequent neighborhoods are
+ * searched, and one or more entries will "hop" into those neighborhoods. When this process works,
+ * an empty bucket will move into the desired neighborhood, allowing the entry to be added. When
+ * that process fails (typically when the buckets are around 90% full), the table must be resized
+ * and the all entries rehashed and added to the expanded table.
+ *
+ * Unlike linear probing, the number of buckets that must be searched in the worst case has a fixed
+ * upper bound (the size of the neighborhood). Those entries occupy a small number of memory cache
+ * lines, leading to improved use of the cache (fewer misses on both successful and unsuccessful
+ * searches). Hopscotch hashing outperforms linear probing at much higher load factors, so even
+ * with the increased memory burden for maintaining the hop vectors, less memory is needed to
+ * achieve that performance. Hopscotch is also immune to "contamination" from deleting entries
+ * since entries are genuinely removed instead of being replaced by a placeholder.
+ *
+ * The published description of the algorithm used a bit vector, but the paper alludes to an offset
+ * scheme which is used by this implementation. Since the entries in the neighborhood are within N
+ * entries of the hash bucket at the start of the neighborhood, a pair of small offset fields each
+ * log2(N) bits wide is all that's needed to maintain the hops as a linked list. In order to encode
+ * "no next hop" (i.e. NULL) as the natural initial value of zero, the offsets are biased by one
+ * (i.e. 0 => NULL, 1 => offset=0, 2 => offset=1, etc.) We can represent neighborhoods of up to 255
+ * entries with just 8+8=16 bits per entry. The hop list is sorted by hop offset so the first entry
+ * in the list is always the bucket closest to the start of the neighborhood.
+ *
+ * While individual accesses tend to be very fast, the table resize operations are very, very
+ * expensive. If an upper bound on the latency of adding an entry to the table is needed, we either
+ * need to ensure the table is pre-sized to be large enough so no resize is ever needed, or we'll
+ * need to develop an approach to incrementally resize the table.

+/*
+ * A priority_table is a simple implementation of a priority queue for entries with priorities that
+ * are small non-negative integer values. It implements the obvious priority queue operations of
+ * enqueuing an entry and dequeuing an entry with the maximum priority. It also supports removing
+ * an arbitrary entry. The priority of an entry already in the table can be changed by removing it
+ * and re-enqueuing it with a different priority. All operations have O(1) complexity.
+ *
+ * The links for the table entries must be embedded in the entries themselves. Lists are used to
+ * link entries in the table and no wrapper type is declared, so an existing list entry in an
+ * object can also be used to queue it in a priority_table, assuming the field is not used for
+ * anything else while so queued.
+ *
+ * The table is implemented as an array of queues (circular lists) indexed by priority, along with
+ * a hint for which queues are non-empty. Steven Skiena calls a very similar structure a "bounded
+ * height priority queue", but given the resemblance to a hash table, "priority table" seems both
+ * shorter and more apt, if somewhat novel.
