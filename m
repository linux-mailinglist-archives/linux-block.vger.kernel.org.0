I'm still not sold on this case yet.  sector size aligned I/O is an
optional feature, and I don't think it is worth this overhead.  And
while file systems metadata can be smaller than the file system block
size in a few cases (e.g. XFS log writes), that is usually an extra
performance optimization and can be trivially disabled in mkfs.
