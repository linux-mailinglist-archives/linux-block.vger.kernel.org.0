I believe we are talking about the same check indeed. Consider the
situation not as a race, but instead consider the state machine of
the ioctl. The BLKTRACESETUP goes first, and when that is over we
have not ran BLKTRACESTART. So, prior to BLKTRACESTART we can have
another BLKTRACESETUP run but against another partition. At that
point we have two cases trying to use the same request_queue and
the same q->blk_trace, even though this was well protected with
the mutex.

And so the final check is needed to ensure we only give one of
the users the right to blktrace.

Did I misunderstand the check though?
