If we do that, q->disk is really unnecessary, so looks the fix of
'd152c682f03c block: add an explicit ->disk backpointer to the request_queue'
isn't good. The original issue added in 'edb0872f44ec block: move the
bdi from the request_queue to the gendisk' can be fixed simply by moving
the two lines code in blk_unregister_queue() to blk_cleanup_queue():

        kobject_uevent(&q->kobj, KOBJ_REMOVE);
        kobject_del(&q->kobj);


Thanks,
Ming
