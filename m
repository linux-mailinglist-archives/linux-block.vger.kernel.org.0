Hi Bart,

Does it really matter that issue IO request by the order of io priority ?

Given a device with a 32 depth queue and doesn't support io priority, even if
we issue the request by the order of io priority, will the fw of device handle
them by the same order ? Or in the other word, we always issue 32 io requests
to device one time and then the fw of device decides how to handle them.
The order of dispatching request from queue may only work when the device's
queue is full and we have a deeper queue in io scheduler. And at this moment,
maybe the user needs to check why their application saturates the block device.

As for the qos policy of io priority, it seems similar with wbt in which read,
sync write and background write have different priority. Since we always want
the io with higher priority to be served more by the device, adapting the depth
of queue of different io priority may work ;)

Best regards
Jianchao
