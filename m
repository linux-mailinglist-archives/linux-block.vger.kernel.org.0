What applications? ZNS does not incur a PO2 requirement. So I really
want to know what applications make this assumption and would break
because all of a sudden say NPO2 is supported.

Why would that break those ZNS applications?

Applications which want to support ZNS have to take into consideration
that NPO2 is posisble and there existing users of that world today.

You cannot negate their existance.

You are just saying things can break but not clarifying exactly what.
And you have not taken a position to say WD will not ever support NPO2
on ZNS. And so, you can't negate the prospect of that implied path for
support as a possibility, even if it means work towards the ecosystem
today.
