Yeah, I agree.

In reality, the channel number of SSD is very limited, it should be
dozens of in enterprise grade SSD, so the device itself can be
saturated by limited in-flight IOs.

However, it depends on if the target device returns the congestion
to host. From my observation, looks there isn't such feedback
from NVMe target.

If SSD target device doesn't provide such kind of congestion feedback,
tracking in-flight per-LUN IO via .device_busy doesn't make any
difference.

Even if there was such SSD target which provides such congestion
feedback, bypassing .device_busy won't cause big effect too since
blk-mq's SCHED_RESTART will retry this IO returning STS_RESOURCE
only after another in-flight one is completed.

At least, Broadcom guys tests this patch on megaraid raid and the results
shows that big improvement was got, that is why the flag is only set
on megaraid host.

In theory, .track_queue_depth may only improve sequential IO's
performance for HDD., not very effective for SSD. Or just save a bit
CPU cycles in case of SSD.

I will study the related drivers/device a bit more wrt. track_queue_depth().
