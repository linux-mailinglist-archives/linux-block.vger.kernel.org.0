A lot of it seems generally useful.  But optimizing for BIO_NO_PAGE_REF
is really special.  Besides a few in-kernel special cases this is all
about the io_uring pre-registered buffers, which are very much a
special case and not a normal workload at all.  In this case it is just
an extra conditional moved into a few callers so I think we're ok, but
I'm really worried about optimizing this benchmark fast path over the
code everyone actually uses.
