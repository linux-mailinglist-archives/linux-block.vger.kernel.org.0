I understand that kind of change isn't needed. When more requests are
dequeued, hctx->dispatch_busy will be updated, then __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched()
won't dequeue at batch any more if either .queue_rq() returns
STS_RESOURCE or running out of driver tag/budget.

Or do you still see related issues after this patch is applied?

Thanks,
Ming
