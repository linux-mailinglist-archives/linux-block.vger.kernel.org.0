Oh absolutely. This patch is needed 100%. Without it, it is actually
pretty trivial to deadlock as noted in my instructions on how to
reproduce.

I have tried that, and it does not resolve the deadlock.

It was *why* I have been insisting that this is a real issue, and why I
decided to instead try to implement something generic after I was hinted
by livepatch folks that they also had observed a similar deadlock, and
so that a generic solution would be appreciated by them.
