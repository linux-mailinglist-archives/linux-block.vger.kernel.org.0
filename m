I'll look closer at other options.

From that bug;
"The currently proposed fix introduces no chance of stability
regressions. There is a chance of a very small performance regression
since an additional pointer comparison is performed on each block layer
request but this is unlikely to be noticeable."

This captures my immediate concern: slowing down everyone for this DM
edge-case isn't desirable.
