Any number of hardware or software bugs might exist that we don't know
about, yet we don't pre-emptively add workarounds for them because where
do you draw the line?

I checked other SCSI/block drivers and found it's rare to poll in the
timeout function so there does not seem to be a consensus that it's
useful to do this.

That said, it's technically fine to do it, the virtqueue APIs are there
and can be used like this. So if you and others think this is necessary,
then it's a pretty small change and I'm not against merging a patch like
this.
