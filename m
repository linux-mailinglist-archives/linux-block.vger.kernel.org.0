With above mentioned patch set, I get following results

buffer ->

number of transactions actually processed: 1001957
latency average = 20.135 ms
tps = 5562.323947 (including connections establishing)
tps = 5562.649168 (excluding connections establishing)

cache ->

number of transactions actually processed: 581273
latency average = 34.745 ms
tps = 3223.520038 (including connections establishing)
tps = 3223.717013 (excluding connections establishing)

With above patch there is performance improvement.

A PostgreSQL setup script will run as part of the setup within RUN to 
install the PostgreSQL DB, configure the /etc/postgresql.conf file and 
initialize the DB.
The RUN script will start the PostgreSQL service and bind it to running 
on half the cpu's, a DB will be created of a default size (I think 16M) 
and will be scaled up to the required size based on whether it is a 
buffer, cache or disk run.

After this, PostgreSQL pgbench will be run in readonly and readwrite 
modes (and be binded to the other half of the cpu's on the system).

Performance issue was seen on readwrite mode.
