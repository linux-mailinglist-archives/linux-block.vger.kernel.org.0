Any information of the system?  What block driver(s) do you use, how
many CPUs, kernel config?

The system did not react to any inputs (Alt+SysRq) or to a short press of the PC's power button, and thus a hard shutdown was necessary.

As with Markus, I've also noticed that a "warm" reboot can result in a frozen system immediately after the boot loader has run.  A full power-off reboot is needed to get past the early screen initialization.
