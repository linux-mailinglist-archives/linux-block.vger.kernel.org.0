Since parisc needs roughly twice the frame (and stack) size as x86,
2048 seemed logical since that's the double of what's used on x86.
Of course we can reduce it, e.g. to 1536.

But then you still will see those warnings in case you choose to not
optize for size.

or bad coding, e.g. huge local variables ot too much nesting of local func=
tions.
