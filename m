I demonstrated a few emails ago that it doesn't take a very large
secure discard command to trigger this.  So, I am sceptical that we
will be able to use splitting to solve this.

My colleague Gwendal pointed out another issue which I had missed:
secure discard is an exclusive command: it monopolizes the device.
Even if we fix this via your approach, it will show up somewhere else,
because other operations to the drive will not make progress for that
length of time.

For Chromium OS purposes, if we had a blank slate, this is how I would solve it:

* Under the assumption that the truly sensitive data is not very big:
    * Keep secure data on a separate partition to make sure that those
LBAs have controlled history
    * Treat the files in that partition as immutable (i.e. no
overwriting the contents of the file without first secure erasing the
existing contents).
    * By never letting more than one version of the file accumulate,
we can guarantee that the secure erase will always be fast for
moderate sized files.

But for all the existing machines with keys on them, we will need to
do something else.
