I agree it should be best effort.

Indeed.

What I wanted by my suggestion was that user could find the error
as soon as something popped up so they could judge what they could
as well as consistency of code structuring. But based on your comment,
they couldn't since several errors are overloaded here. In that case,
it makes my trial void. Another thought is if we could change writeback
work asynchronously(and sync right before returning to the user), it also
will make my trial void. So, yes, your suggestion is much sane.

Could you resend it with dealing with zram_bvec_read failure?
