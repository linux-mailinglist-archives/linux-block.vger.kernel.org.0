I first thought similarly and set the callback to return something.  However,
as this callback is called to simply notify the memory pressure and ask the
driver to free its memory as many as possible, I couldn't easily imagine what
kind of errors that need to be handled by its caller can occur in the callback,
especially because current blkback's callback implementation has no such error.
So, if you and others agree, I would like to simply set the return type to
'void' for now and defer the error handling to a future change.

Yes, such extention would be the right direction.  However, because there is no
existing Linux type to describe the type of resources to reclaim as you also
mentioned, there could be many different opinions about its implementation
detail.  In my opinion, it could be also possible to simply add another
callback for another resource type.  That said, because currently we have an
use case and an implementation for the memory pressure only, I would like to
let it as is for now and defer the extension as a future work, if you and
others have no objection.
