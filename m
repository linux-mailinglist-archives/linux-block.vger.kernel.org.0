Right.

With patch2 in this patchset, timeout handler won't complete the request any
more.

OK, the timeout handler may just get chance to run after recovery is
done, and it can be fixed by calling nvme_sync_queues() after
updating to CONNECTING or before updating to LIVE together with patch 1 & 2.

I didn't think of scenario 3, which seems not triggered in Yi's test.
