Ordering aside, you cannot split more than once.  So your proposed fix
to insert at head isn't valid because you're still implicitly allocating
more than one bio from the bioset which could cause deadlock in a low
memory situation.

I had to deal with a comparable issue with DM core not too long ago, see
this commit:

    dm: fix bio splitting and its bio completion order for regular IO

    dm_queue_split() is removed because __split_and_process_bio() _must_
    handle splitting bios to ensure proper bio submission and completion
    ordering as a bio is split.

    Otherwise, multiple recursive calls to ->submit_bio will cause multiple
    split bios to be allocated from the same ->bio_split mempool at the same
    time. This would result in deadlock in low memory conditions because no
    progress could be made (only one bio is available in ->bio_split
    mempool).

    This fix has been verified to still fix the loss of performance, due
    to excess splitting, that commit 120c9257f5f1 provided.

    Fixes: 120c9257f5f1 ("Revert "dm: always call blk_queue_split() in dm_process_bio()"")
    Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 5.0+, requires custom backport due to 5.9 changes
    Reported-by: Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com>
    Signed-off-by: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>

Basically you cannot split the same bio more than once without
recursing.  Your elaborate documentation shows things going wrong quite
early in step 3.  That additional split and recursing back to MD
shouldn't happen before the first bio split completes.

Seems the proper fix is to disallow max_sectors_kb to be imposed, via
blk_queue_split(), if MD has further splitting constraints, via
chunk_sectors, that negate max_sectors_kb anyway.
