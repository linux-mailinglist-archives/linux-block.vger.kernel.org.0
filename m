Yes, i don't have a reliable re-creator. The oops was noticed as a part 
of stability testing and
was not an intentional try. This was noticed couple of times.
Please share the steps (if any) to easy hit or to exercise this path 
more frequently.
Meanwhile, i will go with the usual stability procedure. i will update 
the results here later.

Yes, it's the same Pradeep. Unfortunately my old email 
"ppvk@codeaurora.org" got expired and
couldn't able to restore. Hence the bounced emails. Now this got 
resolved with a new email
"pragalla@codeaurora.org" which I'm now currently replying.
