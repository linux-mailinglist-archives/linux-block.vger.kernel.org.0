Subject: [PATCH 5/5] bcache: set bcache device into read-only mode for BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_OBSO_LARGE_BUCKET

If BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_OBSO_LARGE_BUCKET is set in incompat feature
set, it means the cache device is created with obsoleted layout with
obso_bucket_site_hi. Now bcache does not support this feature bit, a new
BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_LOG_LARGE_BUCKET_SIZE incompat feature bit is added
for a better layout to support large bucket size.

For the legacy compatibility purpose, if a cache device created with
obsoleted BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_OBSO_LARGE_BUCKET feature bit, all bcache
devices attached to this cache set should be set to read-only. Then the
dirty data can be written back to backing device before re-create the
cache device with BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_LOG_LARGE_BUCKET_SIZE feature bit
by the latest bcache-tools.

This patch checks BCH_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_OBSO_LARGE_BUCKET feature bit
when running a cache set and attach a bcache device to the cache set. If
this bit is set,
- When run a cache set, print an error kernel message to indicate all
  following attached bcache device will be read-only.
- When attach a bcache device, print an error kernel message to indicate
  the attached bcache device will be read-only, and ask users to update
  to latest bcache-tools.

Such change is only for cache device whose bucket size >= 32MB, this is
for the zoned SSD and almost nobody uses such large bucket size at this
moment. If you don't explicit set a large bucket size for a zoned SSD,
such change is totally transparent to your bcache device.

Fixes: ffa470327572 ("bcache: add bucket_size_hi into struct cache_sb_disk for large bucket")
