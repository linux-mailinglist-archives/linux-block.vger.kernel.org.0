I just found the connect command is always submitted via the unique reserve=
d
tag 0, so it is nothing to do with IO requests any more.

You can use the reserved tag 0 for connect command as before just by not
sharing tagset between connect queue and IO queues.

Follows the detailed idea:

1) still reserve 1 tag for connect command in the IO tagset.

2) in each driver, create a conn_tagset for .connect_q only, and create
the .connect_q from this 'conn_tagset', and sets conn_tagset.nr_hw_queues
as 1, and sets conn_tagset.queue_depth as 'ctrl.queue_count - 1'

3) in .queue_rq of conn_tagset.ops:

- parse index of queue to be connected from nvme_command.conn.qid
- set the connect command's tag as 0
- then do every other thing just like before


Thanks,
Ming
