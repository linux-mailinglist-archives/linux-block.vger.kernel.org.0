The result is that when boot with 5.10 kernel compare with 4.4, 5.10
will consume about 1.6s more...

commit 2112f5c1330a671fa852051d85cb9eadc05d7eb7
Author: Bart Van Assche <bvanassche@acm.org>

     loop: Select I/O scheduler 'none' from inside add_disk()

     ...
     e.g. via a udev rule. This approach has an advantage compared to 
changing
     the I/O scheduler from userspace from 'mq-deadline' into 'none', namely
     that synchronize_rcu() does not get called.

Actually, we has meets this problem too 
before(https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-block/msg70660.html).
