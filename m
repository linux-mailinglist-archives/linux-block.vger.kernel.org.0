Xarrays provide pretty efficient as long as we have a unsigned long
or smaller index (check, dev_t is small) and the indices are reasonable
clustered (check, minors for the same major).  Memory usage will go down
vs the probes, and lookup speed up.

I'll have to drop it or add back the put on the delete side.  And
I think the latter is safer for now, because..

I looked at it, but it does get registered and shows up in sysfs.
I don't really dare to touch this for now, as it can have huge
implications.  Better done in a separate series (if we can actually do
it at all).
