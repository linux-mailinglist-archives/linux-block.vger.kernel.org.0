cause of which emails did not get delivered to the mailing list.
Resolved now.)

> Somehow nvme-rdma works:

I think that's because the callchain during the nvme_rdma_init_module
initialization stops at "nvmf_register_transport()". Here only the
"struct nvmf_transport_ops nvme_rdma_transport" is registered, which
contains the function "nvme_rdma_create_ctrl()". I tested this in my
local setup and during kernel boot, that's the extent of the
callchain.
The ".create_ctrl"; which now points to "nvme_rdma_create_ctrl()" is
called later from "nvmf_dev_write()". I am not sure when this is
called, probably when the "discover" happens from the client side or
during the server config. I am trying to test this to confirm, will
send more details once I am done.
Am I missing something here?


> If the rdma_create_id() is not on a callchain from module_init then you don't have a problem.

I am a little confused. I thought the problem occurs from a call to
either "rdma_resolve_addr()" which calls "rdma_bind_addr()",
or a direct call to "rdma_bind_addr()" as in rtrs case.
In both the cases, a call to "rdma_create_id()" is needed before this.


> Similarly they are supposed to be created from the client attachment.
I am a beginner in terms of concepts here. Did you mean when a client
tries to establish the first connection to an rdma server?
