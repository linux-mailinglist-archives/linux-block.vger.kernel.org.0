Yes, that's been the first disk size allowing the overflow to occur. 
This time it's not about partition size but partition block address though.

Thanks, I'll get it from there.

Thanks, that's good enough reason for me to not back out patch 3.

I agree - not meant as a slight to the reviewers but more a dig at my 
patch record.

At least it did show up in testing real fast.

Good, now we just need to see whether it does indeed fix the issue.
