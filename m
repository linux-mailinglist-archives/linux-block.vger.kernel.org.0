Did you even *look* at the patch that started this discussion?

The patch replaced refcount_t, made for no more complex code.

.. which is why I'm fine with refcount_t - for driver reference counts
etc sysfs behavior etc.

What I am *NOT* fine with is somebody then piping up claimign that
refcount_t is "better" than doing it properly by hand, and complaining
about patches that replace it with something else.

See the difference here?

'refcount_t' is fundamentally broken, cannot handle overflows
properly, and is *designed* to do that. You even seem to make excuses
for that very design.

And that "lazy mans overflow protection" is fine if we're talking
random code, and are talking maintainers who doesn't want to deal with
it.

But that is also why I do not EVER want to hear "no, don't convert
away from refcount_t".

Can you really not understand my dislike of a data type that is
fundamentally a lazy shortcut and intentionally hides error cases with
leaks?

Doing it properly is always the better option, and "refcount_t" really
*fundamentally* can never do it properly. It doesn't have the proper
interfaces, and it doesn't return enough information to recover.

I'm not arguing that we have to replace every refcount_t user.

But I *am* arguing that if somebody wants to replace their refcount_t
with something better - whatever the reason - they had better not hear
the mindless whining about it.
