That would consume one more bit of queue->queue_flags.

Besides, DM/MD is somehow special here that when one of the underlying
devices is disabled polling through '/sys/block/<dev>/io_poll',
currently there's no mechanism notifying the above MD/DM to clear the
previously set queue_flags. Thus the outdated queue_flags still
indicates this DM/MD is capable of polling, while in fact one of the
underlying device has been disabled for polling.

Mike had ever suggested that we can trust the queue_flag, and clear the
outdated queue_flags when later the IO submission or polling routine
finally finds that the device is not capable of polling. Currently
submit_bio_checks() will silently clear the REQ_HIPRI flag and still
submit the bio when the device is actually not capable of polling. To
fix the issue, could we break the submission and return an error code in
submit_bio_checks() if the device is not capable of polling when
submitting HIPRI bio?
