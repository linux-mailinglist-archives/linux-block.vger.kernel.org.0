Other exclusive openers will not fail. They will block until we call
bd_abort_claiming() after the partitions have been reread.

I understand many operations are not needed there but this is not a hot
path and leaking of bdev internal details into genhd.c is not a good
practice either (e.g. you'd have to make blkdev_get_whole() extern).

We could create a special helper for partition rescan in block/bdev.c to
hide the details but think that bd_start_claiming() - bd_abort_claiming()
trick is the simplest solution to temporarily grab exclusive ownership if
we don't have it.
