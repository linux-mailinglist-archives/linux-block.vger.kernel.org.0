If you're going to cherry pick a portion of a commit header please
reference the commit id and use quotes or indentation to make it clear
what is being referenced, etc.

This was from the header for commit 07d098e6bba ("block: allow
'chunk_sectors' to be non-power-of-2")

> Suppose the stacked device had a block size/chunk_sectors of 256k.

Quite the tangent just to setup an a toy example of say: thinp with 256K
blocksize/chunk_sectors ontop of a RAID6 with a chunk_sectors of 128K
and stripesize of 1280K.

To be clear, you are _not_ saying using lcm_not_zero() is correct.
You're saying that simply reverting block core back to using
min_not_zero() may not be as good as using gcd().

While that may be true (not sure yet) you've now muddied a conservative
fix (that reverts block core back to its longstanding use of
min_not_zero for chunk_sectors) in pursuit of addressing some different
concern than the case that you _really_ care about getting fixed
(I'm inferring based on your regression report):
4K chunk_sectors stacked on larger chunk_sectors, e.g. 256K

My patch fixes the case and doesn't try to innovate, it tries to get
block core back to sane chunk_sectors stacking (which I broke).

Seriously not amused by your response, I now have to do damage control
because you have a concern that you really weren't able to communicate
very effectively.

But I got this far, so for your above toy example (stacking 128K and
256K chunk_sectors):
min_not_zero = 128K
gcd = 128K

SO please explain to me why gcd() is better at setting a chunk_sectors
that ensures IO doesn't span 1280K stripesize (nevermind that
chunk_sectors has no meaningful relation to io_opt to begin with!).
