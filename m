Honestly, the whole disk revalidation code is confusing to me :) I had to
draw a graph of which function calls which to understand what's going on in
that code and I think it could really use some refactoring. But that's
besides current point :)

Your "only if bdev is invalidated" is true but not actually a full story.
->bd_invalidated effectively gets set only through check_disk_change(). All
other places that end up calling flush_disk() clear bd_invalidated shortly
afterwards. So the function I've created is a direct counterpart to
check_disk_change() that just needs to happen after the device is
successfully open. I wanted to express that in the name - hence
bdev_disk_changed(). So yes, bdev_disk_changed() should be called exactly
when the new disk is present. It is bd_invalidated that is actually
misnamed.

Now I'm not really tied to bdev_disk_changed(). bdev_revalidate_disk()
seems a bit confusing to me though because the disk has actually been
already revalidated in check_disk_change() and the function won't
revalidate the disk for devices with partition scan disabled.

Well, but you don't want to call rescan_partitions() if bd_invalidated is
not set. But yes, we could move bd_invalidated check into
bdev_disk_changed(), but then it would seem less clear why this function is
getting called. This ties somewhat to the discussion above. Hum, I guess if
we call the function just bdev_revalidate(), the name won't be confusing
and it would then make sense to move the bd_invalidated condition in there.
