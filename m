Doesn't matter if it touches core code or not, the cleaner fix is what
matters. But a task flag is not very clean other, don't disagree on
that. Just tossing out ideas to make this palatable.

You bring this up again, why does it matter?

The only benefit that is valid here is the last one, yeah it's an easier
backport. But it's not like that one is that important, the other
suggested fix is a trivial backport as well.

How so? There's no guarantee that the release is sync and inline, in
fact there are already cases where that isn't so, and yours very much
takes advantage of that.

My suggested logic is something ala this in bdev_release():

	if (current->flags & PF_KTHREAD) {
		mutex_lock(&disk->open_mutex);
	} else {
		if (!mutex_trylock(&disk->open_mutex)) {
			deferred_put(file);
			return;
		}
	}

and that's about it.
