You're misunderstanding that it's the _drive_ which gets to decide the
logical block size.  Filesystems literally can't do 4kB writes to these
drives; you can't do a write smaller than a block.  If your clients
don't think it's a good tradeoff for them, they won't tell Linux that
the minimum IO size is 16kB.

Some workloads are better with a 4kB block size, no doubt.  Others are
better with a 512 byte block size.  That doesn't prevent vendors from
offering 4kB LBA size drives.
