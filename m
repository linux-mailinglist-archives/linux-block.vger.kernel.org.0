We're in violent agreement on this part. None of the projects I maintain
throw any warnings, exactly for the same reason. My test box is using
gcc-10 and it definitely hasn't been "clean for years". It is now, and
has been for probably a release or two. The warnings do condition you to
ignore new warnings, which is of course a sad outcome that shouldn't
happen. I don't think anyone sane would disagree on that.

I obviously don't disagree with any of this, it'd be hard to, and it
wasn't really what any of my replies were about. It was about how this
was dealt with. But I won't keep beating the dead horse.

As I said, I'll rebase the branch, and in fact I already did. I likely
won't be able to get it out before after -rc2, which is pretty sad since
there's an nvme regression in there that would have been nice to have.
There's an off chance that I'll send it out tomorrow, depends on timing.
