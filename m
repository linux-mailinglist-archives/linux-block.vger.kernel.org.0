Alright, but I am not really sure what else we need to wait months to 
discuss, unless this shared sbitmap approach is rejected and/or testing 
on other HBAs shows unsatisfactory performance.

To summarize, as I see, we have 3 topics to tackle:

- shared tags

- block hotplug improvement
	- Ming Lei had said that he will post another version of 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20191128020205.GB3277@ming.t460p/

- https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10967071/
	- I'm not sure what's happening on that, but thought that it was 
somewhat straightforward.

If there's something else I've missed, then let me know.

Cheers,
John
