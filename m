Replying to myself as I had an idea:
1) Store the zone capacity in a separate array: 4B * nr_zones needed. Storing
"0" as a value for a zone in that array would indicate that the zone is
conventional. No additional zone bitmap needed.
2) Use a sparse xarray for managing allocated zone write plugs: 64B per
allocated zone write plug needed, which for an SMR drive would generally be at
most 128 * 64B = 8K.

So for an SMR drive with 100,000 zones, that would be a total of 408 KB, instead
of the current 1.6 MB. Will try to prototype this to see how performance goes (I
am worried about the xarray lookup overhead in the hot path).
