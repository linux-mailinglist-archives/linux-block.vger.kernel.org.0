Yeah, so for NVMe, I see some sort of regression, like this:
Jobs: 1 (f=1): [_R] [0.0% done] [0KB/0KB/0KB /s] [0/0/0 iops] [eta 
1158037877d:17h:18m:22s]

I have tested against vanilla 5.4 rc1 without problem.

If you can advise some debug to add, then I'd appreciate it. If not, 
I'll try to add some debug to the new paths introduced in this series to 
see if anything I hit coincides with the error state, so will at least 
have a hint...

Thanks,
John
