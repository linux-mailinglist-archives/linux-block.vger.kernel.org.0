Let's take a step back:  what I/O do we want to account, and how
do we want to archive that?

Assuming accounting is enabled:

 - current mainline accounts all I/O one queues that have a gendisk
 - your original patch accounts file system I/O and some passthrough I/O
   that has a special flag set

Dropping the conditional to grab a bdev from the queue leaves us with
the following rule:

 - all I/O that has a bio and bdev is accounted.  This requires
   passthrough I/O to explicitly set the bdev in case we haven't
   done so, and it requires them to have a bio at all

I guess you are worried about the latter conditionin that we stop
accounting for no data transfer passthrough commands?
