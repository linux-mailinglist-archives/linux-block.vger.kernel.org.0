In principle, yes. But in practice there will _always_ be a limit (even 
if you raise the limit you _still_ have a limit), as essentially the 
number of files is the size of the fd array table.
So you can only have a very large number of fds, but not an infinite 
number of fds.

And experience with multipath-tools have taught us that you hit the fd 
limit far more often than you thought; we've seen installations where we 
had to increase the fd limit beyond 4096
(Mind you, multipath-tools is using only two fds per device).

So on those installations we'll be running out of fds pretty fast if we 
start using one fd per I/O.

Cheers,

Hannes
