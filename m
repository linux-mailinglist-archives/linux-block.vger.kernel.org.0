Both atomic 'depth' and .mq_quiesce_lock can work for nested queue
quiesce since we can avoid unnecessary queue quiesce with the mutex.
percpu_ref_kill() / percpu_ref_kill_and_confirm() can warn if the
percpu_ref has been killed, that is why I think Sagi's suggestion is good.

But 'depth' may cause trouble easily, such as unbalanced quiesce/unquiesce,
however no such issue with mutex, at least we don't require the two to
be paired strictly so far.


Thanks,
Ming
