You can only assign it to zoned write request, but you still have to check
the sequence inside each zone, right? Then why not just check LBAs in
each zone simply?

But not sure if it is easy to make io_uring_cmd_complete_in_task() or
task_work_add to complete request in order efficiently.

The problem is that io_uring_cmd_complete_in_task() or task_work_add() may
re-order the request, can you explain why the issue can be solved by
separate queue?

Let's prove if the theory for each solution is correct first.

In case of batching submission, mq-deadline will order requests by
LBA in this whole batch.

If io_uring_cmd_complete_in_task()/task_work_add() can complete io
commands to ublksrv in order without extra cost, that is better.

But I don't think it is a big deal for HDD. because when these requests
are re-issued from ublksrv to block layer, deadline or bfq will order
them too since all are submitted via io_uring in batch.
