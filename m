What I meant is that sub-range isn't doable.

And pthread is aligned with queue, that is nothing to do with nr_tags.

NVMe PCI isn't special, and it is covered by current ublk abstract, so one way
or another, we should not support both sub-range or non-sub-range for
avoiding unnecessary complexity.

"Each pthread has its own independent tag space" may mean two things

1) each LUN/NS is implemented in standalone process space:
- so every queue of each LUN has its own space, but all the queues with
same ID share the whole queue tag space
- that matches with current ublksrv
- also easier to implement

2) all LUNs/NSs are implemented in single process space
- so each pthread handles one queue for all NSs/LUNs

Yeah, if you mean 2), the tag allocation is cheap, but the existed ublk
char device has to handle multiple LUNs/NSs(disks), which still need
(big) ublk interface change. Also this way can't scale for single queue
devices.

Another thing is that io command buffer has to be shared among all LUNs/
NSs. So interface change has to cover shared io command buffer.

With zero copy support, io buffer sharing needn't to be considered, that
can be a bit easier.

In short, the sharing of (tag, io command buffer, io buffer) needs to be
considered for shared host ublk disks.

Actually I prefer to 1), which matches with current design, and we can
just add host concept into ublk, and implementation could be easier.

BTW, ublk has been applied to implement iscsi alternative disk[1] for Longhorn[2],
and the performance improvement is pretty nice, so I think it is one reasonable
requirement to support "shared host" ublk disks for covering multi-lun or multi-ns.
