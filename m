Right, we don't know, so if we failed without DNR, we assume that
we will retry again and ignore the error. The assumption is that
we will retry when we will reconnect as we don't have a retry mechanism
for these requests.

So you are OK with keeping nvme_submit_sync_cmd returning -ENODEV for
cancelled requests and have the scan flow assume that these are
cancelled requests?

At the very least we need a good comment to say what is going on there.

   Btw,

Never seen it, it's there just because we have allocations in the path.

This does not yet contain sorting out what is discussed here correct?
