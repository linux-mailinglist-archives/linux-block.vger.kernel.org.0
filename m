I guess that would work for the common case of not splitting. If we split,
then it's OK to pay a higher cost. We would have anyway, with the
existing code.

It's definitely easier than it would have been, most things are pretty
streamlined now with the blk-mq conversion. And the ones that don't call
blk_rq_map_sg() usually don't do DMA on the requests. Sizes tend to be
more arbitrary there, and not hard boundaries.

They do, but most of them probably also assume on sg list per request.
We'd have one request now instead of multiple, so either serializing it
(which would definitely suck for some common cases), or doing something
very funky with mapping to multiple requests at the same time.

But I don't think we should argue this much more. If someone wants to do
the work to make this work, even a prototype, it's much better to argue
over actual code then potential issues and wins now.
