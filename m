I did, yes. That's when I noticed the error handling wasn't right, and
doing it correctly was a bit clunky. This series was supposed to make it
easier for drivers to use the new interface.

I am aware shared tags don't get to use the batched queueing, but that's
orthogonal to this series.

Most PCIe NVMe SSDs only have 1 namespace, so it generally works out for
those.
