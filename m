Hi Alexy,

Thanks for your patch. I think I understand why you would suggest the
change, with you strong C background. I would prefer that we do not
apply this change, see below.

I would disagree. To me, and probably to many people who are experienced
in Rust code, the range.contains() formulation is much more clear.

I don't think it looks like noise or Perl. But I am not that experienced
in Perl =F0=9F=A4=B7

What code style are you referring to? We use `rustfmt` default settings
as code style, although I am not sure if that is written down anywhere.

But this is not C. In Rust we have other options.

It might look a little funny, but in general lookups take references to
the key you are searching for. It makes sense for a larger set of types.
In this particular case, I don't think codegen is any different due to
the reference.

I like whitespace. I think it helps make the code more readable.

To me it makes sense to check if a number is in a range with `contains`.
I appreciate that it might not make sense to you, since it is not an
option in C.

Reading Rust takes a bit of practice. Just like reading C takes some
practice to people who have not done it before.

The comment is useful to a person browsing the documentation in the HTML
format. It is available here [1] if you want to have a look.
