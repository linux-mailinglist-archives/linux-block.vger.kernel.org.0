Yeah, I was wondering about that a bit as well. Quick blktests run didn't
trigger any lockdep warning so I thought it's worth a try. But for now I
guess let's not complicate things, it's difficult enough already.

I have checked the code now and it does not seem to cause any obvious harm
if we have block device page cache while changing loop device parameters.
Just some IO may fail, trigger some warning (e.g. IO beyond end of device)
but nothing worse.
