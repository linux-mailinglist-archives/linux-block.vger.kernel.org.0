Not yet, :-(

It is one very good work to show that IO is improved with batching. 

One big question I am still not clear is that how NVMe-TCP performance(
should be throughput according to 'Introduction' part of paper[1]) is
improved much when batching IO is applied. Is it because network stack
performs much well for transporting big chunk data? Or context switch overhead is
reduced because 'Ringing the doorbell' implies worker queue scheduling,
according to '2.4 Delayed Doorbells' of [1]. Or both? Or others? Do we
have data wrt. how much improvement from each factor?

Another question is that 'Introduction' of [1] part mentions that i10 is
more for 'throughput-bound applications'. And 'at low loads, latencies
may be high(within 1.7× of NVMe-over-RDMA latency over storage devices))',
so i10 scheduler is primarily for throughput-bound applications? If yes,
I'd suggest to add the words to commit log for helping people to review.
Then we can avoid to consider IO latency sensitive usages(such as iopoll).
