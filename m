No, there's no practical example yet. It's only a hint from the code base.

Yes, it is, thanks for your explanation. But except for polling if the 
input bio has completed, one of the

important work of polling logic is to reap the completion queue. Let's 
say one bio is split into

two bios, bio 1 and bio 2, both of which are enqueued into the same 
hardware queue.When polling bio1,

though we have no idea about bio2 at all, the polling logic itself is 
still reaping the completion queue of

this hardware queue repeatedly, in which case the polling logic still 
stimulates reaping bio2.


Then what if these two split bios enqueued into two different hardware 
queue? Let's say bio1 is enqueued

into hardware queue A, while bio2 is enqueued into hardware queue B. 
When polling bio1, though the polling

logic is repeatedly reaping the completion queue of hardware queue A, it 
doesn't help reap bio2. bio2 is reaped

by IRQ as usual. This certainly works currently, but this behavior may 
deviate the polling design? I'm not sure.


In other words, if we can ensure that all split bios are enqueued into 
the same hardware queue, then the polling

logic *may* be faster.

Exactly I'm interested in dm polling. The polling of bio to dm device 
can be mapped into the polling of the

several underlying device. Except for the the design of the cookie, 
currently I have not found other blocking

points technically. Please let me know if I missed something.

Sorry I can't understand this. Is this a suggestion on how to improving 
this patch, or a reply to the question

why the split routine is implemented in a recursive style? Would you 
please provide more details?
