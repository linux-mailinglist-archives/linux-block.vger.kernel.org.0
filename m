When bio size is reduced from 32M to 1M:

1MB/(P(1M) + D(1M)) may become bigger than 32MB/(P(1M) + D(1M)), so
throughput is improved.

P(x) means time for preparing 'x' sized IO
D(x) means time for device to handle 'x' sized IO 

I depend on both CPU and the UFS drive.

What I meant is that page faulting might contribute most part of the
100us(preparing 1MB data) and 2ms(preparing 32MB data). It can be others,
but should be easy to figure out.
