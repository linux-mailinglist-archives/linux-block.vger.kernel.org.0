As I mentioned above, IMHO, we could add some per-task state to avoid
the majority of such deadlock cases (also what I mentioned above), but
there may still some potential dependency could happen between threads,
such as using another kernel workqueue and waiting on it (in principle
at least) since userspace program can call any syscall in principle (
which doesn't like in-kernel drivers). So I think it can cause some
risk due to generic userspace block device restriction, please kindly
correct me if I'm wrong.
