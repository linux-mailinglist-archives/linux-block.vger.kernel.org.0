If everything is put into single structure:

1) it is fragile for both userspace/driver side making/paring code
- such as, how to parse zeroed fields? With grouping parameters, if one type
parameter isn't sent via set param command, the userspace just meant we do
not care this parameter just like one real hardare, driver feels free to use
the default. But if it is sent as zero, driver may have to parse it as zero
and use zero, sometimes it can be wrong, and parsing parameter with zero for
kernel becomes hard.

With grouping parameter, if one parameter is sent from userspace, ublk
driver just parses & uses it explicitly. There isn't any burden for driver for
making such decision.

2) ublk driver has to parse every fields, and the code could be harder
to organize, since there isn't parameter group. With grouping
parameters, we just need to implement two callbacks when adding new parameter
type. So code is organized pretty well.

Wrt. cleanness, I will send V2 for review, and please feel free to let me
know where isn't clean, and I am happy to make it correct/clean from the
beginning. And userspace change will be updated too, and we can see
if userspace side has much boilerplate code.

Adding segment limits & zoned limits are in my todo list.

Alibaba said their case needs to run lots of ublk devices in one machine.
It is ABI interface, and I'd rather make it easy extending from the
beginning given there is the requirement for running lots of devices.

In your patch, there isn't length field in ublk_params, not sure ublk
driver can copy back correct parameter. If userspace is old, on new
kernel with bigger structure size userspace buffer could be corrupted
by copying back kernel's structure. So here one length field is really
a must.

With grouping parameters, each type has fixed length which can't be
changed since it is added, we can verify it easily in both set/get param
command, meantime the parameter type can be verified reliably in driver side,
so grouping parameter is more reliable.


Thanks,
Ming
