I did add a mention of it in "Linux-Kernel RCU Shared-Variable Marking"
[1], but just a mention, given that I do not expect that we will use it
within RCU.

Interestingly enough, they can be said to be implicitly marking other
concurrent accesses to the variable.  ;-)

I believe that the do need to be mentioned more prominently, though.

Maybe a second list following this one?  In that case, what do we name
the list?  I suppose the other alternative would be to leave them in
this list, and change the preceding sentence to say something like
"The Linux kernel provides the following access-marking-related primitives"

Thoughts?

Good point.  I removed this item from this list.

Good point, I removed this paragraph.  But we do sometimes use volatile,
for example for atomic_t and jiffies.  Nevertheless, agreed, we don't
want to encourage it and additions of this keyword should be subjected
to serious scrutiny.

Very good, thank you!  I happily took your wording.
