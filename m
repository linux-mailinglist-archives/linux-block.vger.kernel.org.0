I've just sent v5.  I guess I'll try to get it merged for 6.1.  We were a bit
stuck on the read-only DIO issue.  All things considered though, including that
Christoph thinks it's possible for f2fs to support DIO writes on zoned block
devices, I'm willing to bet that read-only DIO doesn't really matter enough for
it to be worth it to add a direction field to STATX_DIOALIGN (which would make
it harder to use STATX_DIOALIGN, as the field would always have to be checked).
