Yes.

I think we need to understand why these requeues even happen.
Unfortunately blk_mq_requeue_request has quite a few callers, so they'll
need a bit of an audit.

Quite a few are about resource constraints in the hardware and or driver.
In this case I suspect it is essential that they are prioritized over
incoming new commands in the way I suggested before.

A different case is nvme_retry_req with the CRD field set, in which
case we want to wait some time before retrying this particular command,
so having new command bypass it makes sense.

Another one is the SCSI ALUA transition delay, in which case we want
to wait before sending commands to the LU again.  In this case we
really don't want to resend any commands until the delay in kicking
the requeue list.

So I'm really not sure what the right thing to is here.  But I'm
pretty sure just skipping head inserts for zoned locked writes is
even more wrong than what we do right now.  And I also don't see
what it would be useful for.  All zoned writes should either be
locked by higher layers, or even better just use zone append and
just get a new new location assigned when requeing as discussed
before.
