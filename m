Yeah, current approach just allocates same share for each active queue
which is evaluated in each timeout period.

That said you are trying to improve the following case:
- heavy IO on one or several disks, and the average share for these
  disks become bottleneck of IO performance
- small amount IO on other disks attached to the same host, and all IOs are
submitted to disk in <30 second period.

Just wondering if you may share the workload you are trying to optimize,
or it is just one improvement in theory? And what is the disk(hdd, ssd
or nvme) and host? And how many disks in your setting? And how deep the tagset
depth is?


Thanks, 
Ming
