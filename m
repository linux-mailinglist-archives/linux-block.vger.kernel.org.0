I'm not sure we are speaking about the same check but I might be missing
something. blk_trace_setup_queue() is only called from
sysfs_blk_trace_attr_store(). That does:

        mutex_lock(&q->blk_trace_mutex);

        bt = rcu_dereference_protected(q->blk_trace,
                                       lockdep_is_held(&q->blk_trace_mutex));
        if (attr == &dev_attr_enable) {
                if (!!value == !!bt) {
                        ret = 0;
                        goto out_unlock_bdev;
                }

		^^^ So if 'bt' is non-NULL, and we are enabling, we bail
instead of calling blk_trace_setup_queue().

Similarly later:

        if (bt == NULL) {
                ret = blk_trace_setup_queue(q, bdev);
	...
so we again call blk_trace_setup_queue() only if bt is NULL. So IMO the
cmpxchg() in blk_trace_setup_queue() could never fail to set the value.
Am I missing something?
