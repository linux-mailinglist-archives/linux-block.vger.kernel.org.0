I agree those are somewhat difficult to test. Although with memory
allocation error injection, we can easily simulate failures in
alloc_holder_object() or say later in bcache_device_init() if that's what
you're after to give at least some testing to the error paths. Admittedly,
I've just tested that registering and unregistering bcache devices works
without giving warnings. Or are you more worried about the "reopen the
block device" logic (and error handling) in the second patch?

It would be doable but frankly I'd prefer to avoid implementing the API for
changing the holder just for bcache. For all I care bcache can also just
generate random cookie (or an id from IDA) and pass it as a holder to
blkdev_get_by_dev(). It would do the job as well and we then don't have to
play games with changing the holder. It would just need to be propagated to
the places doing blkdev_put(). Do you find that better?

I'm now working on a changes that will make blkdev_get_by_dev() return
bdev_handle (which contains bdev pointer but also other stuff we need to
propagate to blkdev_put()) so when that is done, the cookie propagation
will happen automatically.
