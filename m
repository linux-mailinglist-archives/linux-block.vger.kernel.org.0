Even for an RFC, it better be more tested than just being thought
about... If something hasn't been run at all, it should always include
wording to that effect ("Totally untested, but something like this
perhaps"). I have higher expectations for even an RFC patch, I do expect
that to be both thought about AND tested.

If an SQE has both set, it should first wait for any inflight sqe to
complete, then execute the chain. Once things have drained, it should
behave like an SQE that just had LINK set. I'd be interested in seeing a
patch that fixes this instead of just making it illegal, it seems to be
a valid use case.
