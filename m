Yes, it can.  Not sure if my sentence was unclear, but:

 - everything doing non-passthrough I/O only should be in the gendisk
 - everything related to blk-mq, including infrastruture for passthrough
   should remain in the request_queue

The idea that the request_queue will eventually become a blk-mq only
data structure and not exist (or just have a very leight weight stub)
for bio based drivers.
