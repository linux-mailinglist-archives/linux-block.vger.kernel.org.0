I will.  But your following list doesn't reflect any "cleanup" that I
saw in your patchset.  Pretty fundamental changes that are similar,
but different, to the dm-5.19 changes I've staged.

For 5.18 waiting on io->orig_bio just enables a signal that the IO was
split and can be accounted.

For 5.19 I also plan on using late io->orig_bio assignment as an
alternative to the full-blown refcounting currently done with
io->io_count.  I've yet to quantify the gains with focused testing but
in theory this approach should scale better on large systems with many
concurrent IO threads to the same device (RCU is primary constraint
now).

I'll try to write a bpfrace script to measure how frequently "waiting on
io->orig_bio" occurs for dm_submit_bio_remap() heavy usage (like
dm-crypt). But I think we'll find it is very rarely, if ever, waited
on in the fast path.

> 3) no split for io accounting

DM's more recent approach to splitting has never been done for benefit
or use of IO accounting, see this commit for its origin:
18a25da84354c6b ("dm: ensure bio submission follows a depth-first tree walk")

Not sure why you keep poking fun at DM only doing a single split when:
that is the actual design.  DM splits off orig_bio then recurses to
handle the remainder of the bio that wasn't issued.  Storing it in
io->orig_bio (previously io->bio) was always a means of reflecting
things properly. And yes IO accounting is one use, the other is IO
completion. But unfortunately DM's IO accounting has always been a
mess ever since the above commit. Changes in 5.18 fixed that.

But again, DM's splitting has _nothing_ to do with IO accounting.
Splitting only happens when needed for IO submission given constraints
of DM target(s) or underlying layers.

All said, I will look closer at your entire set and see if it better
to go with your approach.  This patch in particular is interesting
(avoids cloning and other complexity of bio_split + bio_chain):
