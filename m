Are you sure that's possible?  That would imply that there is no synchronization
between limits/capabilities in the request_queue being changed and the
request_queue being used.  That's already buggy.  Maybe it's the sort of thing
that is gotten away with in practice, in which case avoiding a free() would
indeed be a good idea, but it's worth explicitly clarifying whether all this
code is indeed racy by design...

Where do all the other limitations and capabilities of the request_queue get
updated on non-initial table loads, then?

I don't understand why this needs to be so complicated.  Doesn't the dm layer
have the same problem for all the other queue limits and capabilities?  What
makes inline encryption different?
