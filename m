The performance issue with this counter is seen more in cases where a single device can produce very high IOPs, for example h/w RAID devices where OS sees one device, but there are many drives behind it, thus being capable of very high IOPs. The effect is also visible when cores from multiple NUMA nodes send IO to the same device or same controller.

In fast path, all cpu increment/decrement their own counter. In relatively slow path. they call scsi_device_busy function to get the total no of IO outstanding on a device. Only functional aspect it changes is that for non-rotating media, the number of IO to a device is not restricted. Controllers which can handle that, can set the use_per_cpu_device_busy flag in scsi_host_template to take advantage of this patch. Other controllers need not modify any code and would work as usual.

Hi Sumanesh,

Can you have a look at the following patch series and see whether it has 
perhaps the same purpose as your patch?

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20191118103117.978-1-ming.lei@redhat.com/

Thanks,

Bart.
