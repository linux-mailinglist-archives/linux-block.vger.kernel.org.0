A global parameter was never a good idea, because systems often have
different types of storage installed which benefit from different I/O
schedulers.  The goal is for the default to just work.

If you feel that the defaults don't work for you, then udev rules are
the way to go.

If you also feel that you really do want to set the default for all
devices, then you can use the following udev rule to emulate the old
elevator= kernel command line parameter:

Cheers,
