do nbd_genl_disconnect(for /dev/nbdX)；
I tested it. Connect /dev/nbdX
through ioctl interface by nbd-client -L -N export localhost /dev/nbdX and
through netlink interface by nbd-client localhost XXXX /dev/nbdX,
disconnect /dev/nbdX by nbd-client -d /dev/nbdX.
Both call nbd_genl_disconnect(for /dev/nbdX) and both contain the same 
null pointer dereference.

Yes, nbd_disconnect_and_put could then reference a null recv_workq.

I am also not very sure which is better.
because in nbd_config_put, not only recv_workq is null,
nbd->task_recv and nbd->config the same.
so I doubt that if step 4 do something else will also reference a null 
pointer.

Yes, I realize it. Just add a check for a non null task_recv in 
nbd_genl_disconnect is better, right?

I thought the changes in nbd_genl_reconfigure is necessary althought my 
test do not call it. but now I think it is superfluous, 
nbd_genl_reconfigure checks for a non null task_recv.
