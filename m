The CPU ID is just percpu READ, and unlikely() has been used for
optimizing the conditional branch. And smp_mb() could cause CPU stall, I
guess, so it should be much slower than reading CPU ID.

Let's see the attached microbench[1], the result shows that smp_mb() is
10+ times slower than smp_processor_id() with one conditional branch.

[    1.239951] test_foo: smp_mb 738701907 smp_id 62904315 result 0 overflow 5120

The micronbench is run on simple 8cores KVM guest, and cpu is
'Model name:          Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8665U CPU @ 1.90GHz'.

Result is pretty stable in my 5 runs of VM boot.

It can be documented easily.

I have added big comment on this usage in V10 already.
