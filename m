Hi Jens,

This time the situation was awkward, indeed I didn't expect I can submit 
the fix in this merge window, but just around 1 week before I found the 
difficult was from influence by other depending issues. After fixed all 
of them and do I/O pressure testing for 24x2 hours, it comes to such 
close day to the merge window.

My confusion was, it was very close to the merge window so maybe I 
should submit them in next merge window (5.20), but this series were bug 
fixes which should go into mainline earlier. It seems neither option was 
proper, so I chose the first one...

Could you give me a hint, what is the proper way that I should do for 
such situation? Then I will try to follow that and avoid adding more 
workload to you.

Thanks in advance.


Coly Li
