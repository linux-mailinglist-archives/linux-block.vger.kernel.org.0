disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() is a nop for any zone write plug that does not
have BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE set. And that flag is set only for zones
that had a write error. Given that recovering from write errors on zoned device
requires to:
1) stop writing to the zone,
2) Do a report zone (which will sync the wp offset)
3) Restart writing
there is no write IOs going on for the zone that is being reported, for a well
behaved user. If the user is not well behaved, it will get errors/out of sync
wp, until the user behaves :) So I would not worry too much about this.
As we discussed, the table switching should be allowed only for the wildcard
target (dm-error) and that's it. We should not allow table switching otherwise.
And given that inserting dm-error does not cause any change to the zone
configuration, I do not see why we need to revalidate zones.

We should not allow the zone configuration to change. That is impossible to
deal with at the user level.

I think it can happen today but no-one ever had this issue because no-one has
tried to switch a dm-table on a zoned drive. And I really think we should
prevent that from being done, except for dm-error since that's used for fstests.
