I understand and I have never said the opposite. Append is a great
addition that we also have been working on for several months (see
patches additions from today). We just have a couple of use cases where
append is not required and I would like to make sure that they are
supported.

At the end of the day, the only thing I have disagreed on is that the
NVMe driver rejects ZNS SSDs that do not support append, as opposed to
doing this instead when an in-kernel user wants to utilize the drive
(e.g., formatting a FS with zoned support) This would allow _today_
ioctl() passthru to work for normal writes.

I still believe the above would be a more inclusive solution with the
current ZNS specification, but I can see that the general consensus is
different.

So we will go back, apply the feedback that we got and return with an
approach that better fits the ecosystem.

I think I will refrain from discussing our business strategy on an open
mailing list. Appreciate the feedback though. Very insightful.

Thanks,
