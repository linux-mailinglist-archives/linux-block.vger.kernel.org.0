OK. Now we will complete a request in block softirq, which means the
irq thread of host driver should call blk_mq_complete_request() to
complete this request (triggering the block softirq) and call
blk_mq_run_hw_queues() to dispatch another request in this context.

Right. Need to improve this as you suggested.

Right.

Yes, seems reasonable to me.

Yes, we can use queue_rq()/commit_rqs() and bd->last (now bd->last may
can not work well, see [1]), but like we talked before, for packed
request, we still need some new interfaces (for example, a interface
used to start a packed request, and a interface used to complete a
packed request), but at last we got a consensus that we should re-use
the CQE interfaces instead of new invention.

I checked the 'struct blk_mq_ops', and I did not find a ops can be
used to do DMA management. And I also checked UFS driver, it also did
the DMA mapping in the queue_rq() (scsi_queue_rq() --->
ufshcd_queuecommand() ---> ufshcd_map_sg()). Maybe I missed something?

Moreover like I said above, for the packed request, we still need
implement something (like the software queue) based on the CQE
interfaces to help to handle packed requests.
