My thinking is that this simplification can be done in a userland
core library with a simpler interface for backends to plug into (or
a richer interface if that is what the use-case warrants).

"inverse" io_uring is just a ring interface, tcmu has it as well, I'm
assuming you are talking about the scalability attributes of it...
