I don=E2=80=99t think the splat is the issue. The issue is the blocking =
behavior,
which is both unconditional and unbounded in time, and (worse) takes =
place
without relinquishing the locks. wait_event_timeout() is therefore not a
valid solution IMHO.

I understand your considerations. My intuition is that just as umount
cannot be done while a file is opened and would return -EBUSY, so should
deleting the ublock while the ublk is in use.

So as I see it, there are 2 possible options for proper deletion of =
ublk,
and actually both can be implemented and distinguished with a new flag
(UBLK_F_*):

1. Blocking - similar to the way it is done today, but (hopefully) =
without
   holding locks, and with using wait_event_interruptible() instead of
   wait_event() to allow interruption (and return EINTR if interrupted).

2. Best-effort - returning EBUSY if it cannot be removed.

I can imagine use-cases for both, and it would also allow you not to
change ubdsrv if you choose so.

Does it make sense?
