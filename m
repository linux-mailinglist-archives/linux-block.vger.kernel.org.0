Might as well finish the git blame:

    scsi: ufs: ufshpb: Add HPB 2.0 support
        
    Version 2.0 of HBP supports reads of varying sizes from 4KB to 1MB.

    A read operation <= 32KB is supported as single HPB read. A read between
    36KB and 1MB is supported by a combination of write buffer command and HPB
    read command to deliver more PPN. The write buffer commands may not be
    issued immediately due to busy tags. To use HPB read more aggressively, the
    driver can requeue the write buffer command. The requeue threshold is
    implemented as timeout and can be modified with requeue_timeout_ms entry in
    sysfs.
