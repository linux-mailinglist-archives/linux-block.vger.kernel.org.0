Hey Chris

I see that Markus followed-up with:

====
Well, turns out I should've googled (or at least looked at the bcache wiki entry) at first, which points to a known bug involving bcache and 5.12: https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-bcache/msg10077.html

I still find it interesting that I get the same symptoms that James describes, but other than that the issues don't seem to be related.
====

For my part, I also had to re-run my bisect, with more thorough testing.  The result changed, and we are currently investigating the final commit, at 4f432e8bb15b x86/mce: Get rid of mcheck_intel_therm_init().

So now, I expect that my issue has nothing to do with your patch set.  Sorry about the noise.  If you still have an interest in my issue, there are posts going to linux-smp and lkml.

James

The system did not react to any inputs (Alt+SysRq) or to a short press of the PC's power button, and thus a hard shutdown was necessary.

As with Markus, I've also noticed that a "warm" reboot can result in a frozen system immediately after the boot loader has run.  A full power-off reboot is needed to get past the early screen initialization.
