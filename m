Not necessarily. When the priority for an IO is set when a BIO is prepared, we
know where that priority come from:
1) The user kiocb through aio_reqprio
2) The process ionice context
3) priority cgroups

We can disable (2) and (3) and leave (1) as is.

Trying to solve this issue in mq-deadline would require keeping track of the io
priority used for a write request that is issued to a zone and use that same
priority for all following write requests for the same zone until there are no
writes pending for that zone. Otherwise, you will get the priority inversion
causing the reordering.

But I think that doing all this without also causing priority inversion for the
user, i.e. a high priority write request ends up waiting for a low priority one,
will be challenging, to say the least.
