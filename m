We can certainly add it to the man pages talking about RWF_NOWAIT. But
there's never been a guarantee that any EAGAIN will later succeed
under the same conditions, and honestly there are various conditions
where this is already not true. And those same cases would spuriously
yield EAGAIN before already, it's not a new condition for those sizes
of IOs.
