Not always. If the write that is being failed by null_handle_badblocks() makes
(or keeop) the zone open, that it is still correct. The zone condition is fine
as long as the zone does not become full. What is wrong though is that we will
also increment the zone write pointer before running null_handle_badblocks(), so
if the write is failed by that function, we endup with an incorrect write
pointer. But the zone condittion is not necessarily wrong. As commented before,
a real device will always open a zone before accessing the media. So an empty or
closed zone will always become open even if the write operation fails on the
first sector of the write.

Understood. But to be completely correct with the zone condition handling, we
should probably also do the zone resource management even if the write is failed
on its first sector, that is, even if the actual number of sectors to write is 0.
