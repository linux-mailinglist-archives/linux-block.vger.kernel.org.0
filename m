It happens all the time with SCSI devices. It is imperative that this
keeps working.

The reason we back off is that it allows the device to recover by
temporarily reducing its workload. In addition, the lower queue depth
alleviates the risk of commands timing out leading to application I/O
failures.

I do not question that it improves performance. That's not my point.

This is not about performance. This is about how the system behaves when
a device is starved for resources or experiencing transient failures.
