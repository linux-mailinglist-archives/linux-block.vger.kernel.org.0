're-configure the zram module' is confused, and it should be zram
device.

Otherwise, the above is pretty good, and I will take that in V3.

commit log is for helping people to understand the change, and too long or
exposing too much details may not serve that purpose since we also talk with
code, and I believe the following words are clear enough for explaining the
problem, and it is short & straightforward, and won't make people terrified, :-)

	But reset_store() may set ->claim which will fail zram_remove(), when
	this happens, zram_reset_device() is bypassed, and zram->comp can't
	be destroyed, so the warning of 'Error: Removing state 63 which has
	instances left.' is triggered during unloading module.

When zram_remove() is run from module unloading path, it shouldn't be
failed cause no one owns any zram disk since unloading module, that is
why I add WARN_ON_ONCE() in zram_remove_cb() for document benefit because
zram_remove() is called from two contexts. But it can be failed in case of
hot removing.

->claim is only set in reset_store(), so it is enough for avoiding
zram_remove failure during unloading module.
