If we are clear about

  Now your patch will fix this lockdep complaint but we
  still would wait for the write to complete through blk_mq_freeze_queue()
  (just lockdep is not clever enough to detect this). So IHMO if there was a
  deadlock before, it will be still there with your changes.

in https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20211223134050.GD19129@quack2.suse.cz ,
we can go with the revert approach.

I want to call blk_mq_freeze_queue() without disk->open_mutex held.
But currently lo_release() is calling blk_mq_freeze_queue() with
disk->open_mutex held. My patch is going towards doing locklessly
where possible.

Using task work from lo_release() is for handling close() => umount() sequence.
Using task work in lo_open() is for handling close() => open() sequence.
The mount in

  while :; do mount -o loop,ro isofs.iso isofs/; umount isofs/; done

fails unless lo_open() waits for __loop_clr_fd() to complete.

Right. But regarding that part the main problem is that the script is not checking
for errors. What we are expected to do is to restore barrier which existed before
commit 322c4293ecc58110 ("loop: make autoclear operation asynchronous").

My waiting in lo_open() is to fix a regression that

  while :; do mount -o loop,ro isofs.iso isofs/; umount isofs/; done

started to fail.

Excuse me, but lo_open() does not return EBUSY?
What operation are you talking about?

If lo_open() from /bin/mount happened earlier than close() from systemd-udevd
happens, __loop_clr_fd() from systemd-udevd does not happen because lo_open()
incremented lo->lo_refcnt, and autoclear will not happen until /bin/mount
calls close().

If you are talking about close() => umount() sequence, do_umount() can fail
with EBUSY if /bin/umount happened earlier than close() from systemd-udevd
happens. But that is out of scope for use of task work in lo_open().
