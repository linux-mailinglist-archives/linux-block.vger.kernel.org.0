{sigh}

What tools rely on this?  If none, just don't add new stuff to the file
and work to create a new api instead.

Best solution, come up with a new api.

Worst solution, you are stuck with the existing file and I can show you
the "way out" of dealing with files larger than 4kb in sysfs that a
number of other apis are being forced to do as they grow over time.

But ideally, just drop ths api and make a new one please.

thanks,
