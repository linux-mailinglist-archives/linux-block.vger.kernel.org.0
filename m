Hi all

Thanks for reporting about this. I did a test in my environment.
time blkdiscard /dev/nvme5n1  (477GB)
real    0m0.398s
time blkdiscard /dev/md0
real    9m16.569s

I'm not familiar with the block layer codes. I'll try to understand
the codes related with discard request and
try to fix this problem.

I have a question for raid5 discard, it needs to consider more than
raid0 and raid10. For example, there is a raid5 with 3 disks.
D11 D21 P1 (stripe size is 4KB)
D12 D22 P2
D13 D23 P3
D14 D24 P4
...  (chunk size is 512KB)
If there is a discard request on D13 and D14, and there is no discard
request on D23 D24. It can't send
discard request to D13 and D14, right? P3 =3D D23 xor D13. If we discard
D13 and disk2 is broken, it can't
get the right data from D13 and P3. The discard request on D13 can
write 0 to the discard region, right?

If so, it can handle a discard bio at a time that is big enough at
least to contain the data. (data disks * chunk size). In this case the
size is 1024KB (512KB*2).

Regards
Xiao
