Hello dear,

How are you today?
I am Sgt.Leighann.Hester, 32 years old, single & never married before. I am
from Florida USA, a US army by profession. I am here to disclose an
important issue to you as I promised. Please don't expose this secret if
you do not find my offer interesting. Actually, I have about $10.5 Million
Dollars and jewelry packed in a box which I deposited in Globlink Security
& Cargo company vault in Afghanistan for safeguarding. This money was my
share of the enormous amount we made out of the money we encountered during
one of our missions while in Afghanistan.

Now that the US military has been pulled out from Kabul by the order of
President Biden, I am back in the USA but have been seriously sick.
The purpose of this mail is to know if I can trust you enough to request
the security company to move the boxes to your address and once I recover,
I will come over to your home to pick the box. If you can do me this favor,
you will be entitled to 40% of the money and some shares of the jewelry.
The company director had told me that during the evacuation, they relocated
to spain. So, the box is currently in Spain.

If you can assure me of your trust and never disappoint or betray me upon
reception of the luggage, kindly get back to me with your full name,
address, and direct mobile number to enable me draft a letter of
recommendation and send it to the security company immediately .
Sincerely yours,

Sgt.Leighann.Hester,
