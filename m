If the multiple storages devices are independent, the current ublk can
handle them just fine.

But if these storage devices(such as luns in iscsi, or NSs in nvme-tcp)
share single host, and use host-wide tagset, the current interface can't
work as expected, because tags is shared among all these devices. The
current ublk interface needs to be extended for covering this case.
