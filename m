Dear Lukas,

You're welcome, thank you for the code.

Yes true, but I guess your existing style is harder to split across
lines in a clean way. As mentioned, I didn't mind the original code, but
the line length is a fair point. Your call on this one - those with far
more experience than me would probably argue the if/else form though.

Same, guilty as charged on this one - live and learn I guess :-)

Yeah, maybe just a bit more in the comment to emphasize the room for
extra bits in has_changed? I agree it looks fine like this to me though
given the lack of struck packing anyway.

I agree with you on this personally, I think it's fine.
