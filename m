Hi Bart,

Please help me understand this solution. The background is that we are 
unsure if the SCSI iters callback functions may sleep. So we use the 
blk_mq_all_tag_iter_atomic() iter, which tells us that we must not 
sleep. And internally, it uses rcu read lock protection mechanism, which 
relies on not sleeping. So it seems that we're making the SCSI iter 
functions being safe in atomic context, and, as such, rely on the iter 
callbacks not to sleep.

But if we call the SCSI iter function from non-atomic context and the 
iter callback may sleep, then that is a problem, right? We're still 
using rcu.

Thanks,
John
