Sure, but how would that solve the potential deadlock problem ? ALso, I am not
entirely clear on how the deadlock can happen given that zone write plugs are
queueing/blocking BIOs, not requests. So even assuming you have a large number
of BIOs plugged in a zone write plug, the error handler work should still be
able to issue a request to do a report zones, no ? On which resource can the
deadlock happen ? Plugged BIOs do not yet use a tag, right ?

What am I missing here ? Or is it maybe something that can happen with your
modifications because you changed the zone write plug behavior to allow for more
than one BIO at a time being unplugged and issued to the device ?

Note that if you do have a test case for this triggering the deadlock, we
definitely need to solve this and ideally have a blktest case checking it.
