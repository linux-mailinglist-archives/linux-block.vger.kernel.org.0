Hi,

I'm sure that in my repoducer bfq_setup_merge() nerver merge two
bfqq from diferent group(I added some debuginfo before), and somehow
later bfqq and bfqq->new_bfqq end up from different bfqg.

I haven't thought of merge bfqqs from diferent group yet. My reporducer
probably can't cover this case...

This modification is just a lazy detection for the problem. It's right
that fix the problem in the first scene is better.

Thanks,
Kuai
