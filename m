Sorry about that we noticed this right after we sent the report and worked quickly to resolve it on our end,
the logs are now accessible in the external artifacts location.

Agreed, this is also something we'd like to do and we have an outstanding ticket to work on it.
I'll follow up and see if we can move this along quicker to make it easier to find it in the reports.

We are working on open sourcing our dashboard (datawarehouse) and in the process of reworking it. This is
one of our main priorities right now. Once the data warehouse is public, it will be linked in the upstream
reports and it will make it easier to find related logs/failures going forward.

Thanks for all the feedback!
