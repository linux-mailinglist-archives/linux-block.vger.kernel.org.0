Christoph, I don't know what you're claiming here. I see no tweaks in
the original patch, that's all code I wrote.

I always try to CC people with relevant expertise, and that _definitely_
includes the person who authored the code being changed.

And considering the multiple times I've had to track down bugs you and
Jens introduced into code I wrote without CCing me...

You brought up the bdev NULL check.

There was no need for you to drop the EXPORT_SYMBOL.

What I want to know is, is this going to become a pattern?

I can vendorize this one function, but If you're going to make a habit
of ripping out exports and functionality bcachefs depends on, I can't
expect I'll always be able to. There's open bug on the bcachefs bug
tracker for 6.18 support, and people are just patching the kernel to
deal with this. I'll just pass the bcachefs enablement patches to the
distros if it looks like that's going to be less of a hassle.

With the lib/Kconfig patch to make library code user selectable that you
also nacked, perhaps that's the safer route here.
