It would help if the submission came with an explanation of why they are
being submitted so late, as I really do expect it to happen around -rc7
time. Sometimes it's just because people are a bit lazy getting changes
submitted, and then do it at that last minute. That makes me a bit
annoyed. And other times there are totally legitimate reasons for why
they are being submitted late, like your explanation above.

It really depends on the scope of the changes, too. Simple fixes are
obviously fair game at any time.
