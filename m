Yeah, I know, just find this maybe an issue by reading codes :)

Indeed, I have described how filesystem implementations avoid this issue
in patch's commit message:

  Filesystem implementations will also run into this issue, but they
  usually lock page when vm_operations_struct->fault gets one page, and
  unlock page after finish_fault() completes. In truncate sides, they
  lock pages in truncate_inode_pages() to protect race with page fault.
  We can also have similar codes like filesystem to fix this issue.


Take ext4 as example, a file in ext4 is mapped to user space, if then a truncate
operation occurs, ext4 calls truncate_pagecache():
void truncate_pagecache(struct inode *inode, loff_t newsize)
{
        struct address_space *mapping = inode->i_mapping;
        loff_t holebegin = round_up(newsize, PAGE_SIZE);

        /*
         * unmap_mapping_range is called twice, first simply for
         * efficiency so that truncate_inode_pages does fewer
         * single-page unmaps.  However after this first call, and
         * before truncate_inode_pages finishes, it is possible for
         * private pages to be COWed, which remain after
         * truncate_inode_pages finishes, hence the second
         * unmap_mapping_range call must be made for correctness.
         */
        unmap_mapping_range(mapping, holebegin, 0, 1);
        truncate_inode_pages(mapping, newsize);
        unmap_mapping_range(mapping, holebegin, 0, 1);
}

In truncate_inode_pages(), it'll lock page and set page->mapping
to be NULL, and in ext4's filemap_fault(), it'll lock page and check whether
page->mapping has been changed, if it's true, it'll just fail the page
fault procedure.

For tcmu, though the data area's pages don't have a valid mapping,
but we can apply similar method.
In tcmu_vma_fault(), we lock the page and set VM_FAULT_LOCKED
flag, in find_free_blocks(), we firstly try to lock pages which are going
to be released, if lock_page() returns, we can ensure that there are
not inflight running page fault procedure, and following unmap_mapping_range()
will also ensure that all user maps will be cleared.
Seems that it'll resolve this possible issue, please have a check, thanks.

Xiaoguang Wang
