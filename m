A real machine test would definitely be a requirement. What real world
uses cases is this solving? These days most devices have plenty of tags,
and I would not really expect tag starvation to be much of a concern.

However, I do think there's merrit in fixing the unfairness we have
here. But not at the cost of all of this. Why not just simply enforce
more strict ordering of tag allocations? If someone is waiting, you get
to wait too.

And I don't see much utility at all in tracking how many splits (and
hence tags) would be required. Is this really a common issue, tons of
splits and needing many tags? Why not just enforce the strict ordering
as mentioned above, not allowing new allocators to get a tag if others
are waiting, but perhaps allow someone submitting a string of splits to
indeed keep allocating.

Yes, it'll be less efficient to still wake one-by-one, but honestly do
we really care about that? If you're stalled on waiting for other IO to
finish and release a tag, that isn't very efficient to begin with and
doesn't seem like a case worth optimizing for me.
