But isn't it a problem if struct floppy_raw_cmd is exposed to uapi ?
That said I remember a discussion with Linus who said that most if not
all of the floppy parts leaking to uapi were more of a side effect of
the include files reordering than a deliberate decision to expose it.
So maybe that could remain the best solution indeed.

I must say I don't feel very comfortable either with replacing p[i]
with *(p+i) given that they are all supposed to be interchangeable and
equivalent (as well as i[p] as strange as it can look). So we're not
really protected against a later mechanical change or cleanup that
reintroduces it :-/
