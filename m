That is also not doable.

The tag space can be pretty small, such as, usb-storage queue depth
is just 1, and usb card reader can support multi lun too.

That is just one extreme example, but there can be more low queue depth
scsi devices(sata : 32, ...), typical nvme/pci queue depth is 1023, but
there could be some implementation with less.

More importantly subrange could waste lots of tags for idle LUNs/NSs, and
active LUNs/NSs will have to suffer from the small subrange tags. And available
tags depth represents the max allowed in-flight block IOs, so performance
is affected a lot by subrange.

If you look at block layer tag allocation change history, we never take
such way.
