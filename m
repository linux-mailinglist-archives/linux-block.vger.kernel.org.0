Well, yes, but if you expose the root of the shared filesystem to the
container, the container is probably meant to have a higher level of
access than if only a bind mount is exposed? But I don't know.

We should have some sort of reasonable policy outside of LSM code
though - the kernel should still be secure even if no LSMs are built
into it.

I'm extremely twitchy when it comes to code like this because AFAIK
gcc at least used to sometimes turn code that read a value from memory
and then used it multiple times into something with multiple memory
reads, leading to critical security vulnerabilities; see e.g. slide 36
of <https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Wilhelm-Xenpwn-Breaking-Paravirtualized-Devices.pdf>.
I am not aware of any spec that requires the compiler to only perform
one read from the memory location in code like this.
