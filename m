Yes, sorry, you are right, your patch does add this.  But if anything else =
changes
the NONROT attribute for a queue associated with a SCSI device in the futur=
e
it would have to freeze the queue.  Because the device_busy counter mechani=
sm
would rely on it to work right.  This isn't an obvious connection, it seems=
 to me.
