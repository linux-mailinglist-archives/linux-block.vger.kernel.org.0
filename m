nvme_start_freeze() just prevents new IO from being queued, and old ones
may still be entering block layer queue, and what matters here is
actually quiesce, which prevents new IO from being queued to
driver/hardware.

time out only happens after the request is queued to driver/hardware, or after
blk_mq_start_request() is called in nvme_queue_rq(), but quiesce actually
prevents new IOs from being dispatched to driver or be queued via .queue_rq(),
meantime old requests have been canceled, so no any request can be
timed out.
