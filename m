However, IO latency is often much longer than latency of bio fast clone,
which is just one fix-sized slab allocation, mostly should hit cache.

I understand the current issue should be the cost of blk_queue_split() in
case of no splitting is required. blk_bio_segment_split() has been
simple enough, looks we need to investigate why it is so slow since
it shouldn't be such in-efficient.
