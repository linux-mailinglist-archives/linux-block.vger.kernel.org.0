Hi

For normal read/write requests, it needs to consider parity
calculation. Now it uses page size as the unit. The whole design
is based on this. So it's very hard to change this. But there are many
efforts to improve the performance. The batch requests
can improve the performance.
https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg47207.html. It can help to avoid
to send many small
bios to disks.

And for the discard part, I'll try to do this job.

Regards
Xiao
