Well, but I do think that Coly is right in that bio_data_dir() is very 
unconvincing, or at least improperly documented.

I can't quite follow Christoph's argument in that bio_data_dir() 
reflects whether data is _actually_ transferred (if so, why would 
REQ_OP_ZONE_CLOSE() be marked as WRITE?)
However, in most cases bio_data_dir() will only come into effect if 
there are attached bvecs.

So the _correct_ usage for bio_data_dir() would be to check if there is 
data attached to the bio (eg by using bio_has_data()), and only call 
bio_data_dir() if that returns true. For false you'd need to add a 
switch evaluating the individual commands.

And, btw, bio_has_data() needs updating, too; all the zone commands are 
missing from there, too.

Cheers,

Hannes
