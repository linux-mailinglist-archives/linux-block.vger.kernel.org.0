Thanks Damien for having provided this additional information. This is 
very helpful. I see this as a welcome evolution since the disk firmware 
has more information than the CPU (e.g. about the disk head position) 
and hence can make a better decision than an I/O scheduler or cgroup policy.

For the cloud use case, are all disks used to implement disaggregated 
storage? I'm asking this because in a disaggregated storage setup the 
I/O submitter runs on another server than the server to which the disks 
are connected. In such a setup I expect that the I/O priority will be 
provided from user space instead of being provided by a cgroup.

Bart.
