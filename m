I think that would be quite fragile IMO, I wouldn't recommend relying
on domain IDs.

What I would do instead is add a new attribute to
xl-disk-configuration [0] that allows setting the persistent grants
usage on a per-disk basis, and that should be passed to blkback in a
xenstore node.

I agree. I'm happy to take patches to implement more fine grained
control, but that shouldn't prevent us from having a global policy if
that's useful to users.
