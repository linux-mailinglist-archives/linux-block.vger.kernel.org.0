Hi Jens,

This patch series improves small write IOPS by a factor of four (+300%) for
zoned UFS devices on my test setup with an UFSHCI 3.0 controller. Please
consider this patch series for the next merge window.

Thank you,

Bart.

Changes compared to v11:
 - Fixed a NULL pointer dereference that happened when booting from an ATA
   device by adding an scmd->device != NULL check in scsi_needs_preparation().
 - Updated Reviewed-by tags.

Changes compared to v10:
 - Dropped the UFS MediaTek and HiSilicon patches because these are not correct
   and because it is safe to drop these patches.
 - Updated Acked-by / Reviewed-by tags.

Changes compared to v9:
 - Introduced an additional scsi_driver callback: .eh_needs_prepare_resubmit().
 - Renamed the scsi_debug kernel module parameter 'no_zone_write_lock' into
   'preserves_write_order'.
 - Fixed an out-of-bounds access in the unit scsi_call_prepare_resubmit() unit
   test.
 - Wrapped ufshcd_auto_hibern8_update() calls in UFS host drivers with
   WARN_ON_ONCE() such that a kernel stack appears in case an error code is
   returned.
 - Elaborated a comment in the UFSHCI driver.

Changes compared to v8:
 - Fixed handling of 'driver_preserves_write_order' and 'use_zone_write_lock'
   in blk_stack_limits().
 - Added a comment in disk_set_zoned().
 - Modified blk_req_needs_zone_write_lock() such that it returns false if
   q->limits.use_zone_write_lock is false.
 - Modified disk_clear_zone_settings() such that it clears
   q->limits.use_zone_write_lock.
 - Left out one change from the mq-deadline patch that became superfluous due to
   the blk_req_needs_zone_write_lock() change.
 - Modified scsi_call_prepare_resubmit() such that it only calls list_sort() if
   zoned writes have to be resubmitted for which zone write locking is disabled.
 - Added an additional unit test for scsi_call_prepare_resubmit().
 - Modified the sorting code in the sd driver such that only those SCSI commands
   are sorted for which write locking is disabled.
 - Modified sd_zbc.c such that ELEVATOR_F_ZBD_SEQ_WRITE is only set if the
   write order is not preserved.
 - Included three patches for UFS host drivers that rework code that wrote
   directly to the auto-hibernation controller register.
 - Modified the UFS driver such that enabling auto-hibernation is not allowed
   if a zoned logical unit is present and if the controller operates in legacy
   mode.
 - Also in the UFS driver, simplified ufshcd_auto_hibern8_update().

Changes compared to v7:
 - Split the queue_limits member variable `use_zone_write_lock' into two member
   variables: `use_zone_write_lock' (set by disk_set_zoned()) and
   `driver_preserves_write_order' (set by the block driver or SCSI LLD). This
   should clear up the confusion about the purpose of this variable.
 - Moved the code for sorting SCSI commands by LBA from the SCSI error handler
   into the SCSI disk (sd) driver as requested by Christoph.
   
Changes compared to v6:
 - Removed QUEUE_FLAG_NO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCK and instead introduced a flag in
   the request queue limits data structure.

Changes compared to v5:
 - Renamed scsi_cmp_lba() into scsi_cmp_sector().
 - Improved several source code comments.

Changes compared to v4:
 - Dropped the patch that introduces the REQ_NO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCK flag.
 - Dropped the null_blk patch and added two scsi_debug patches instead.
 - Dropped the f2fs patch.
 - Split the patch for the UFS driver into two patches.
 - Modified several patch descriptions and source code comments.
 - Renamed dd_use_write_locking() into dd_use_zone_write_locking().
 - Moved the list_sort() call from scsi_unjam_host() into scsi_eh_flush_done_q()
   such that sorting happens just before reinserting.
 - Removed the scsi_cmd_retry_allowed() call from scsi_check_sense() to make
   sure that the retry counter is adjusted once per retry instead of twice.

Changes compared to v3:
 - Restored the patch that introduces QUEUE_FLAG_NO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCK. That patch
   had accidentally been left out from v2.
 - In patch "block: Introduce the flag REQ_NO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCK", improved the
   patch description and added the function blk_no_zone_write_lock().
 - In patch "block/mq-deadline: Only use zone locking if necessary", moved the
   blk_queue_is_zoned() call into dd_use_write_locking().
 - In patch "fs/f2fs: Disable zone write locking", set REQ_NO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCK
   from inside __bio_alloc() instead of in f2fs_submit_write_bio().

Changes compared to v2:
 - Renamed the request queue flag for disabling zone write locking.
 - Introduced a new request flag for disabling zone write locking.
 - Modified the mq-deadline scheduler such that zone write locking is only
   disabled if both flags are set.
 - Added an F2FS patch that sets the request flag for disabling zone write
   locking.
 - Only disable zone write locking in the UFS driver if auto-hibernation is
   disabled.

Changes compared to v1:
 - Left out the patches that are already upstream.
 - Switched the approach in patch "scsi: Retry unaligned zoned writes" from
   retrying immediately to sending unaligned write commands to the SCSI error
   handler.

Bart Van Assche (16):
  block: Introduce more member variables related to zone write locking
  block: Only use write locking if necessary
  block/mq-deadline: Only use zone locking if necessary
  scsi: core: Introduce a mechanism for reordering requests in the error
    handler

  scsi: sd_zbc: Only require an I/O scheduler if needed
  scsi: scsi_debug: Add the preserves_write_order module parameter
