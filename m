Great, thanks. Looking forward to your report.

So, from my side, me and Anders Roxell, have been collaborating on
testing the behaviour on a TI Beagleboard x15 (remotely with limited
debug options), which is using the sdhci-omap variant. I am trying to
get hold of an Nvidia jetson-TX2, but not found one yet. These are the
conclusions from the observed behaviour on the Beagleboard for the
CMD6 cache flush command.

First, the reported host->max_busy_timeout is 2581 (ms) for the
sdhci-omap driver in this configuration.

1. As we all know by now, the cache flush command (CMD6) fails with
-110 currently. This is when MMC_CACHE_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS is set to 30 *
1000 (30s), which means __mmc_switch() drops the MMC_RSP_BUSY flag
from the command.

2. Changing the MMC_CACHE_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS to 2000 (2s), means that
the MMC_RSP_BUSY flag becomes set by __mmc_switch, because of the
timeout_ms parameter is less than max_busy_timeout (2000 <  2581).
Then everything works fine.

3. Updating the code to again use 30s as the
MMC_CACHE_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS, but instead forcing the MMC_RSP_BUSY to be
set, even when the timeout_ms becomes greater than max_busy_timeout.
This also works fine.

Clearly this indicates a problem that I think needs to be addressed in
the sdhci driver. However, of course I can revert the three discussed
patches to fix the problem, but that would only hide the issues and I
am sure we would then get back to this issue, sooner or later.

To fix the problem in the sdhci driver, I would appreciate if someone
from TI and Nvidia can step in to help, as I don't have the HW on my
desk.

Comments or other ideas of how to move forward?

Kind regards
Uffe
