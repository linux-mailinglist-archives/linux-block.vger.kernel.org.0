So I tried reading through more of blk-mq and the IO schedulers to figure
out how to do this. As far as I can tell, requests may be merged with
each other until they're taken off the scheduler. So ideally, we'd
program a keyslot for a request when it's taken off the scheduler, but
this happens from within an atomic context. Otoh, programming a keyslot
might cause the thread to sleep (in the event that all keyslots are in use
by other in-flight requests). Unless I'm missing something, or you had some
other different idea in mind, I think it's a lot easier to stick to letting
blk-crypto program keyslots and manage them per-bio...
