Hi,

We want to support that configuration in parent cgroup will work on
child cgroup in cgroup v1. The feature was once supported and was
reverted in commit 67e9c74b8a87 ("cgroup: replace __DEVEL__sane_behavior
with cgroup2 fs type").

Switching to cgroup v2 can support that, however, the cost is too high
because all of our products are using v1, and there's a big difference
in usage between v1 and v2.

My question is that why is the feature reverted in cgroup v1? Is it
because there are some severe problems? If not, we'll try to backport
the feature to cgroup v1 again.

Thanks,
Kuai
