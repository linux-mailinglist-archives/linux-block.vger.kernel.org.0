Hi

POV of lvm2 developer - there are 2 things to solve - 1st. is the introdu=
ction=20
of a new 'features'. The 2nd. is usability/stability of certain version o=
f dm=20
targets - so when we later discover some combination of device stack are =
not=20
safe to use (can lead to significant lose of user's data) lvm2 adds check=
 for=20
this.

The reason for complexity comes from fact - numerous distribution use ver=
sion
of kernel X.Y.Z while they can have much new DM target version as it's mu=
ch=20
more simple to backport new DM into older version.

Nothing is clearly 'perfect', there is no ideal solution to cover all=20
combination of all kernel backports - but current separate versioning str=
eam
of DM targets added to kernel versioning, which i.e. lvm2 also is trackin=
g,=20
adds more hints for safe decision (as the safety of user's data is the mo=
st=20
important here)  and allows various distributions to 'somehow reasonably'=
=20
handle backporting of bugfixes.

So if there would be 'feature flag' list provided by DM target - there st=
ill=20
should be visible which version of implemented flag is that - as when the=
 new=20
feature is added - it's not always 'perfect' - sometimes we discover q bu=
g=20
quite late in the process of new feature introduction - so the plain fact=
=20
'featureXYZ' is present unfortunately doesn't always mean it's usable.
Sometimes even 'fixing' one bug may introduce a new problem we discover a=
gain=20
later (testing combinations of device stacks is really madness of its own=
...)
