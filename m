Because the caller need to make sure that dispatch critical area is
gone, otherwise dispatch code path may see intermediate state of the
change, such as switching elevator, and __blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues()
may need quiesce too, I remember that there was kernel panic log in
some test.

Please see the point in commit 662156641bc4 ("block: don't drain
in-progress dispatch in blk_cleanup_queue()").


Thanks,
