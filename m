That's w/o iocost QoS targets configured, right? iocost should be able to
achieve similar results as wrr with QoS configured.

As I wrote before, the issues I see with wrr are the followings.

* Hardware dependent. Some will work ok or even fantastic. Many others will do
  horribly.

* Lack of configuration granularity. We can't configure it granular enough to
  serve hierarchical configuration.

* Likely not a huge problem with the deep QD of nvmes but lack of queue depth
  control can lead to loss of latency control and thus loss of protection for
  low concurrency workloads when pitched against workloads which can saturate
  QD.

All that said, given the feature is available, I don't see any reason to not
allow to use it, but I don't think it fits the cgroup interface model given the
hardware dependency and coarse granularity. For these cases, I think the right
thing to do is using cgroups to provide tagging information - ie. build a
dedicated interface which takes cgroup fd or ino as the tag and associate
configurations that way. There already are other use cases which use cgroup this
way (e.g. perf).

Thanks.
