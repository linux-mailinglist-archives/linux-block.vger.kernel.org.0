I think no-return is a red herring (or rather, I don't think noreturn
is at play here at all). Looking at the IR, I don't see anything that
indicated anything was deduced to be noreturn.

It looks like this is coming from the loop in __find_restype() being
fully unrolled.

On the initial iteration, `type` =3D=3D `M5MOLS_RESTYPE_MONITOR` =3D=3D 0.
`m5mols_default_ffmt` is a 2 element array.
If we don't match we loop again, `type` =3D=3D `M5MOLS_RESTYPE_CAPTURE` =3D=
=3D 1.
`SIZE_DEFAULT_FFMT` =3D=3D ARRAY_SIZE(m5mols_default_ffmt) =3D=3D 2, so we =
loop again.
`type` =3D=3D 2, accessing m5mols_default_ffmt out of bounds.

Perhaps this code meant to simply use a for loop rather than do-while?
(Or pre-increment rather than post increment for the do-while)?

I think Linus is thinking about,
commit e5d523f1ae8f ("ubsan: disable UBSAN_DIV_ZERO for clang")

I can see the loop unroller inserting a branch on "poison" which is a
magic value in LLVM related to but distinct from "undef".  That gets
replaced with an "unreachable" instruction.
I wonder if we can change loop unroller to not insert branch on poison
when the sanitizers are enabled, or freeze poison.
https://llvm.org/devmtg/2020-09/slides/Lee-UndefPoison.pdf

Maybe Linus has thoughts he can share on this thread:
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56289?

Finally, there's always `-mllvm -trap-unreachable` though that's a
last resort kind of thing; `-mllvm` flags need to be passed to the
linker for LTO, and compiler for non-LTO and LTO.  I do think in this
case that the fallthough is bringing to our attention an issue in the
source.
