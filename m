Does:
    lsscsi -U
or
    lsscsi -UU

solve your problem, or come close?

Example:
# lsscsi -UU
[1:0:0:0]    disk    naa.5000cca02b38d0b8  /dev/sda
[1:0:1:0]    disk    naa.5000c5003011cb2b  /dev/sdb
[1:0:2:0]    enclosu naa.5001b4d516ecc03f  -
[N:0:1:1]    disk    eui.e8238fa6bf530001001b448b46bd5525    /dev/nvme0n1

The first two (SAS SSDs) NAAs are printed on the disk labels. I don't
think either that enclosure or the M2 NVMe SSD have their numbers
visible (i.e. the last two lines of output).

If it is what you want, then perhaps you could arrange for its output
to be sent to the log when the system has stabilized after a reboot. That
would only leave disk hotplug events exposed.

Faced with the above medium error I would try:
    dd if=<all_possibles> bs=512 skip=43578 iflag=direct of=/dev/null count=1
and look for noise in the logs. Change 'bs=512' up to 4096 if that is
the logical block size. For <all_possibles> use /dev/sde (and /dev/sdf and
/dev/dev/sdg or whatever) IOWs the _whole_ disk device name.
