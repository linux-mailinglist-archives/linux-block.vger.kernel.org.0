Not illegal at all. libata-scsi is a SAT implementation which can do that. The
problem with multi-queue HBAs is that delaying NCQ commands with also the
non-NCQ ones delayed does not guarantee that the non-NCQ command will be the
first one to show up once the queue is drained. So this is not trivial... Not
sure how to do it yet.

An "ugly" solution would be to use a submission workqueue in libata-scsi that
holds on to the non-NCQ command instead of sending it back for requeue. But
that's not pretty and holding on command in the low level driver is not great.
Still thinking.
