Actually, I'd rather have something like an 'inverse io_uring', where an 
application creates a memory region separated into several 'ring' for 
submission and completion.
Then the kernel could write/map the incoming data onto the rings, and 
application can read from there.
Maybe it'll be worthwhile to look at virtio here.

But in either case, using fds or pipes for commands doesn't really 
scale, as the number of fds is inherently limited. And using fds 
restricts you to serial processing (as you can read only sequentially 
from a fd); with mmap() you'll get a greater flexibility and the option 
of parallel processing.

Cheers,

Hannes
