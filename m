Not on async LUN Reset, no.
But I'm working on a patchset to update/fix SCSI EH yet again, by 
dropping the 'scmd' argument for the various SCSI EH callbacks, and use 
the respective object (eg SCSI device for device reset, SCSI Host for 
host reset etc) as arguments instead.
This gets rid of quite some complexity in the callbacks, and allows us 
to finally handle out-of-band resets via ioctl properly.

Once that is done we could be doing async (or, rather, parallel) LUN 
Resets, as each of the reset is in principle independent, and we're not 
bound to individual SCSI commands anymore.

I really need to polish off my patchset ...

Cheers,

Hannes
