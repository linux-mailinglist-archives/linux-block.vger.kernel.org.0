Percpu accesses aren't uniformly cheap across architectures.

Nobody said anything about smp_mb() in a tight loop, so this is hardly
surprising. Throughput of barrier instructions will hit a ceiling fairly
quickly, but they don't have to cause stalls in general use. I would expect
the numbers to converge if you added some back-off to the loops (e.g.
ndelay() or something). But I was really hoping for some numbers from the
block layer itself, since that's what we actually care about.

Honestly, I get the impression that you're not particularly happy with me
putting in the effort to review your patches, so I'll leave it up to
Christoph as to whether he wants to predicate the concurrency design on
a hokey microbenchmark.

FWIW: I agree that the code should work as you have it in v10, I just think
it's unnecessarily complicated and fragile.

/me goes to review other things
