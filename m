(+Mike Snitzer)

Hmm, I haven't found any reference to the device mapper in the document 
written by Francesc. Maybe that means that I overlooked something?

I referred to the dm-crypt driver because I think that's an example that 
shows that QCOW2 file format support could be implemented using the 
device mapper framework.

Mike, do you perhaps want to comment on what the most appropriate way is 
to implement such functionality? The entire patch series is available at 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/86279379-32ac-15e9-2f91-68ce9c94cfbf@manuel-bentele.de/T/#t.

Thanks,

Bart.
