I'm curious about the sequential IO part in particular, what's the blocksize and throughput?
If blocksize is large enough the completion and submission parts are hopefully not as critical.

As Qais hinted at, because of systems that share LLC on all CPUs but are HMP.

So I'm assuming you're seeing something like the following:
Some CPU(s) (call them S) are submitting IO, hardirq triggers on
S.
Before the patch the completion softirq could run on a !S CPU,
now it runs on S. Am I then correct in assuming your workload
is CPU-bound on S? Would you share some details about the
workload, too?

What's the capacity of CPU(s) S then?
IOW does this help?
