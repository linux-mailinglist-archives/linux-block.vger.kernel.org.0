Could you elaborate more on this?  I/O seems to be controllable on ext4.

Actually, the problem is suffered by sync random reads, which always
hit the disk in this test.

I'm not getting why non-direct sync reads, or buffered writes, should
be uncontrollable.  As a trivial example, BFQ in this tests controls
I/O as expected, and keeps latency extremely low.

What am I missing?
