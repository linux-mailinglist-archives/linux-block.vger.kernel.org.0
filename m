The backing file is used during I/O.  So you certainly can't change
it while I/O is in flight.

But the important point is that there is nothing inherent about
"internal" attributes needing different synchronization.  Maybe some
field don't need a full I/O quiesce, but you need to explain that
for each and every single one of them.

"typical" does not matter.  The required synchronization needs to be
provided even for non-typical use cases.

I did not say it isn't widely used.  Which is part of the problem.
