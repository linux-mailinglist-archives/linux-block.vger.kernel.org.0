Arguably configfs should just be disabled if loading with nr_devices
larger than 0, as it's a mess of an API as it stands. But probably too
late for that. The fact that we also have an option that's specific to
configfs just makes it even worse.

I don't know much about configfs, but pre-populating with the configured
devices and options would be ideal and completely solve this. I think
that would be the best solution given the current situation. Not that
it's THAT important, null_blk is a developer tool and as such can have
some sharper and rouger edges. Still would be nice to make it saner,
though.
