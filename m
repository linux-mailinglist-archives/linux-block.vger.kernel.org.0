The reasons are mostly that it's ancient technology and my doubt was
that nobody used it, and it's completely unmaintained code as well.

If there are folks using the code (successfully), it's not going away.
But I can't quite tell from your email if you're just planning to use
it, or if you are using it already and it's working great for you?

It's not really a case of quid pro quo, if someone gets removed,
something else can stay. I'd argue that the floppy driver is probably
used by orders of magnitude more people than the packet writing code,
and as such that makes it much more important to maintain.
