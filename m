I haven't assessed it yet.

There are things like rbtree sorting that is also hooked off async, but
that is more meaningful for rotational storage.

No, you've got it.

My thinking was to introduce the ability to avoid the workqueue code via
opt-in and then we can evaluate the difference it has on different
classes of storage.

More conservative approach that also allows me to not know the end from
the beginning... this was work driven by others so on this point I
rolled with what was proposed since I personally don't have the answer
(yet) on whether workqueue is actually helpful.  Best to _really_ know
that before removing it.

I'll make a point to try to get more eyes on this to see if it makes
sense to just eliminate the workqueue code entirely (or invert the
default).  Will keep you updated.

Mike
