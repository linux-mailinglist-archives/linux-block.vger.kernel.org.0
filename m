I don't remember the details on that front, it's usually very difficult
to get people to test this kind of change, unfortunately. But thanks for
tackling it now!

OK, that's good enough then. Was mostly just curious if was actually
being used.

You only need to care about bd->last if you have something in the driver
that can make it cheaper to commit more than one request. An example is
a driver that fills in requests, and then has an operation to ring the
submission doorbell to flush them out. The latter is what ->commit_rqs
is for.

For a floppy driver, just ignore bd->last and don't implement
commit_rqs, I don't think we're squeezing a lot of extra efficiency out
of it through that! Think many hundreds of thousands of IOPS or millions
of IOPS, not a handful of IOPS or less.
