What I meant is to freeze a request queue temporarily (until hot
unplugging of a CPU has finished). I would never suggest to freeze a
request queue forever and I think that you already knew that.

I think that the block layer needs to be notified after the decision has
been taken to offline a CPU and before the interrupts associated with
that CPU are disabled. That would allow the block layer to freeze a
request queue without triggering any timeouts (ignoring block driver and
hardware bugs). I'm not familiar with CPU hotplugging so I don't know
whether or not such a mechanism already exists.

What I propose is to fix those block drivers instead of complicating the
block layer core further and instead of introducing potential deadlocks
in the block layer core.

Freezing a request queue for a short time is acceptable. As you know we
already do that when the queue depth is modified, when the write-back
throttling latency is modified and also when the I/O scheduler is changed.

If a request neither can be aborted nor completes then that's a severe
bug in the block driver that submitted the request to the block device.

Bart.
