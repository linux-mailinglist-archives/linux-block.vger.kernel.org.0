I can also do all kinds of other bad things when I really want to.  So
if a privileged user uses *fdisk, or explicitly calls
blockdev --rereadpt, we can expect this behavior, and all of them above
should not be frequent.

It seems like the main culprit is systemd, so please look into what is
going wrong there.
