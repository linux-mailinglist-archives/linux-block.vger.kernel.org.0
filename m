I think it's hard to judge which cases are smoke-test cases commonly, especially
you hope they should all pass if no real bugs. If for "all filesystems", I have to
recomment some simple cases of fsx and fsstress only... Even if we can add
a group name as 'smoke', and mark all stable and simple enough test cases
as 'smoke', but I still can't be sure './check -g smoke' will test pass for
your all filesystems testing with random system environment :)
