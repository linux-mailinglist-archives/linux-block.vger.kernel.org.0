I get the use case aspect of this. But the above still does not clearly explains
things. E.g.: "host->can_queue is identical to the maximum queue depth per
logical unit" -> As I mentioned, SCSI does not define/advertize a maximum queue
depth per LU (beside the transport defined maximum of course). So Is this
something that UFS defines outside of SCSI/SBC ? Also, for UFS, is it always one
host per LU ? (that would be odd, the "device" here should be the host and you
say it can have multiple LUs).

But if I understand this correctly, you are saying that a UFS device is like
SATA and can_queue == device max queue depth, so we are always guaranteed that
if you can allocate a tag, you will be able to issue the command, right ?

.change_queue_depth is defined for AHCI too, with ata_scsi_change_queue_depth().

I am still not sure what you are trying to say here and what this proposed
change will do.
