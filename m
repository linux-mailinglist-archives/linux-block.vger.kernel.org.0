No.

queue_count is fixed at 16, but pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity() still
may return less vectors, which is one system-wide resource, and queue
count is device resource.

So when less vectors are allocated, you should have been capable of using
more poll queues, unfortunately the current code can't support that.

Even worse, hisi_hba->cq_nvecs can become negative if less vectors are returned.

You said queue mapping for HCTX_TYPE_DEFAULT is broken, but it isn't.

You said 'we originally spread 16x vectors over all CPUs', which isn't
true. Again, '16 - iopoll_q_cnt' vectors are spread on all CPUs, and
same with iopoll_q_cnt vectors.

Since both blk_mq_map_queues() and blk_mq_pci_map_queues() does spread
map->nr_queues over all CPUs, so there isn't spread a subset of CPUs.
