That's quite an understatement.

Right, which in the worst case could expose a firmware bug or whatever.

So I see this as a critical fix too. And it gets me wondering what has
happened for 512 byte controllers on 4K PAGE_SIZE?

Length, 100 is an exception. I'm sticking to the old school 80.

Same.

It would seem like max_dev_sectors would have saved the day too,
but that is said to be set by the "disk" on the documentation.
I see scsi/sd.c and drivers/s390/block/dasd_*.c set this too,
is that a layering violation, or was that to help perhaps with
similar problems? If not could stroage controller have used this
for this issue as well?

Could the documentation for blk_queue_max_hw_sectors() be enhanced to
clarify this?

The way I'm thinking about this is, if this is a fix for stable too,
what would a minimum safe stable fix be like? And then after whatever
we need to make it better (non stable fixes).
