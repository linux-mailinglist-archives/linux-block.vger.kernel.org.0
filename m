Subject: [PATCH 29/37] bcache: shrink btree node cache after bch_btree_check()

When cache set starts, bch_btree_check() will check all bkeys on cache
device by calculating the checksum. This operation will consume a huge
number of system memory if there are a lot of data cached. Since bcache
uses its own mca cache to maintain all its read-in btree nodes, and only
releases the cache space when system memory manage code starts to shrink
caches. Then before memory manager code to call the mca cache shrinker
callback, bcache mca cache will compete memory resource with user space
application, which may have nagive effect to performance of user space
workloads (e.g. data base, or I/O service of distributed storage node).

This patch tries to call bcache mca shrinker routine to proactively
release mca cache memory, to decrease the memory pressure of system and
avoid negative effort of the overall system I/O performance.
