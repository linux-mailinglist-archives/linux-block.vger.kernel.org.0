Regardless of where I've been, I can't really review things which
don't show up in my radar. The patches didn't even cc cgroups mailing
list. How would I know that I needed to review the patches?

That part of the comment was on the specific fomatting that you used.
cgroup interface files follow a few styles to stay consistent and ease
parsing. Please refer to Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst.

Well, there's nothing specific to mq-deadline or any other elevator or
controller about the stats that your patch collected and showed. That
seems like a pretty straight forward sign that it likely doens't
belong there.

Thanks.
