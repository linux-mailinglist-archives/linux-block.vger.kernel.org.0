Great - I'm pleasantly surprised to have been not so far off,
and we seem to be much in accord.

(What I called wake_up_nr_return() can perfectly well be wake_up_nr()
itself: I had just been temporarily avoiding a void to int change in
a header file, recompiling the world.)

Many thanks for your detailed elucidation of the batch safety,
in particular: I won't pretend to have absorbed it completely yet,
but it's there in your mail for me and all of us to refer back to.

No problem in the testing, the v2 patch follows now.
