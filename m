Yes that's my point, nobody will know that the hints do nothing, all I
care about here is that the user ABI doesn't change. I know I originally
advocated for -EINVAL and I do think it's correct for _most_ cases, it's
just that it does have the potential to mess up a legit kernel upgrade
scenario which is exactly the kind of thing we don't want to happen.
