Unfortunately I have not had a chance, sorry. But I can look again.

So I have only seen KASAN use-after-free's myself, but never an actual 
oops. IIRC, someone did report an oops.

@Pradeep, do you have a reliable re-creator? I noticed the timeout 
handler stackframe in your mail, so I guess not. However, as an 
experiment, could you test:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/1608203273-170555-2-git-send-email-john.garry@huawei.com/

This should fix the common issue. But no final solution to issues 
discussed from patch 2/2, which is more exotic.

BTW, is this the same Pradeep who reported:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/1606402925-24420-1-git-send-email-ppvk@codeaurora.org/

I did cc ppvk@codeaurora.org on earlier version of my series, but it 
bounced.
