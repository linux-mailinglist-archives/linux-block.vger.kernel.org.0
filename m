Feel like I already answered this in detail but... correct, DM cannot
and should not use stacked chunk_sectors as basis for splitting.

Up until 5.9, where I changed DM core to set and then use chunk_sectors
for splitting via blk_max_size_offset(), DM only used its own per-target
ti->max_io_len in drivers/md/dm.c:max_io_len().

But I reverted back to DM's pre-5.9 splitting in this stable@ fix that
I'll be sending to Linus today for 5.10-rcX:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-5.10-rcX&id=6bb38bcc33bf3093c08bd1b71e4f20c82bb60dd1

DM is now back to pre-5.9 behavior where it doesn't even consider
chunk_sectors for splitting (NOTE: dm-zoned sets ti->max_io_len though
so it is effectively achieves the same boundary splits via max_io_len).

With that baseline established, what I'm now saying is: if DM, the most
common limits stacking consumer, cannot benefit from stacked
chunk_sectors then what stacked device does benefit?  Could be block
core's stacked chunk_sectors based splitting is good enough for others,
just not yet seeing how.  Feels like it predates blk_queue_split() and
the stacking of chunk_sectors could/should be removed now.

All said, I'm fine with leaving stacked chunk_sectors for others to care
about... think I've raised enough awareness on this topic now ;)
