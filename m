I assume 2892100bc85ae446088cebe0c00ba9b194c0ac9d is 5.4-stable's
backport of upstream commit 120c9257f5f19e5d1e87efcbb5531b7cd81b7d74 ?

No, it really isn't a good idea given what was documented in the commit
header for commit 120c9257f5f19e5d1e87efcbb5531b7cd81b7d74 -- the
excessive splitting is not conducive to performance either.

So I think we need to identify _why_ reverting this commit is causing
such a performance improvement.  Why is calling blk_queue_split() before
dm_queue_split() benefiting your pgbench workload?

Thanks,
Mike
