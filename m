I assumed you were referring to this, but good that you pointed this
out, for clarity.

I have considered that, but not sure what would be the best option.

mmc_erase() is used for both REQ_OP_DISCARD and REQ_OP_SECURE_ERASE,
but that's an implementation detail that we can change, of course.

Honestly, the hole erase/discard support in the mmc core deserves a
cleanup and I am looking at that (occasionally).

I would assume that too.

On the other hand, I guess there are situations when user space could
live with slow formatting times. In particular if the goal is to let
card clean up its internal garbage, as a way to improve "performance"
for later I/O writes.

Sounds great, looking forward to hear more about your findings.
