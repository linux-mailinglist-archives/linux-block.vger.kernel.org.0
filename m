This patch adds funnel_queue, a mostly lock-free multi-producer,
single-consumer queue. It also adds the request queue used by the dm-vdo
deduplication index, and the work_queue used by the dm-vdo data store. Both
of these are built on top of funnel queue and are intended to support the
dispatching of many short-running tasks. The work_queue also supports
priorities. Finally, this patch adds vdo_completion, the structure which is
enqueued on work_queues.

+/**
+ * DOC: vdo completions.
+ *
+ * Most of vdo's data structures are lock free, each either belonging to a single "zone," or
+ * divided into a number of zones whose accesses to the structure do not overlap. During normal
+ * operation, at most one thread will be operating in any given zone. Each zone has a
+ * vdo_work_queue which holds vdo_completions that are to be run in that zone. A completion may
+ * only be enqueued on one queue or operating in a single zone at a time.
+ *
+ * At each step of a multi-threaded operation, the completion performing the operation is given a
+ * callback, error handler, and thread id for the next step. A completion is "run" when it is
+ * operating on the correct thread (as specified by its callback_thread_id). If the value of its
+ * "result" field is an error (i.e. not VDO_SUCCESS), the function in its "error_handler" will be
+ * invoked. If the error_handler is NULL, or there is no error, the function set as its "callback"
+ * will be invoked. Generally, a completion will not be run directly, but rather will be
+ * "launched." In this case, it will check whether it is operating on the correct thread. If it is,
+ * it will run immediately. Otherwise, it will be enqueue on the vdo_work_queue associated with the
+ * completion's "callback_thread_id". When it is dequeued, it will be on the correct thread, and
+ * will get run. In some cases, the completion should get queued instead of running immediately,
+ * even if it is being launched from the correct thread. This is usually in cases where there is a
+ * long chain of callbacks, all on the same thread, which could overflow the stack. In such cases,
+ * the completion's "requeue" field should be set to true. Doing so will skip the current thread
+ * check and simply enqueue the completion.
+ *
+ * A completion may be "finished," in which case its "complete" field will be set to true before it
+ * is next run. It is a bug to attempt to set the result or re-finish a finished completion.
+ * Because a completion's fields are not safe to examine from any thread other than the one on
+ * which the completion is currently operating, this field is used only to aid in detecting
+ * programming errors. It can not be used for cross-thread checking on the status of an operation.
+ * A completion must be "reset" before it can be reused after it has been finished. Resetting will
+ * also clear any error from the result field.

+/*
+ * A funnel queue is a simple (almost) lock-free queue that accepts entries from multiple threads
+ * (multi-producer) and delivers them to a single thread (single-consumer). "Funnel" is an attempt
+ * to evoke the image of requests from more than one producer being "funneled down" to a single
+ * consumer.
+ *
+ * This is an unsynchronized but thread-safe data structure when used as intended. There is no
+ * mechanism to ensure that only one thread is consuming from the queue. If more than one thread
+ * attempts to consume from the queue, the resulting behavior is undefined. Clients must not
+ * directly access or manipulate the internals of the queue, which are only exposed for the purpose
+ * of allowing the very simple enqueue operation to be inlined.
+ *
+ * The implementation requires that a funnel_queue_entry structure (a link pointer) is embedded in
+ * the queue entries, and pointers to those structures are used exclusively by the queue. No macros
+ * are defined to template the queue, so the offset of the funnel_queue_entry in the records placed
+ * in the queue must all be the same so the client can derive their structure pointer from the
+ * entry pointer returned by uds_funnel_queue_poll().
+ *
+ * Callers are wholly responsible for allocating and freeing the entries. Entries may be freed as
+ * soon as they are returned since this queue is not susceptible to the "ABA problem" present in
+ * many lock-free data structures. The queue is dynamically allocated to ensure cache-line
+ * alignment, but no other dynamic allocation is used.
+ *
+ * The algorithm is not actually 100% lock-free. There is a single point in uds_funnel_queue_put()
+ * at which a preempted producer will prevent the consumers from seeing items added to the queue by
+ * later producers, and only if the queue is short enough or the consumer fast enough for it to
+ * reach what was the end of the queue at the time of the preemption.
+ *
+ * The consumer function, uds_funnel_queue_poll(), will return NULL when the queue is empty. To
+ * wait for data to consume, spin (if safe) or combine the queue with a struct event_count to
+ * signal the presence of new entries.
