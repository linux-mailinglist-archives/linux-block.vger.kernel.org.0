+/**
+ * DOC: Bio flags.
+ *
+ * For certain flags set on user bios, if the user bio has not yet been acknowledged, setting those
+ * flags on our own bio(s) for that request may help underlying layers better fulfill the user
+ * bio's needs. This constant contains the aggregate of those flags; VDO strips all the other
+ * flags, as they convey incorrect information.
+ *
+ * These flags are always irrelevant if we have already finished the user bio as they are only
+ * hints on IO importance. If VDO has finished the user bio, any remaining IO done doesn't care how
+ * important finishing the finished bio was.
+ *
+ * Note that bio.c contains the complete list of flags we believe may be set; the following list
+ * explains the action taken with each of those flags VDO could receive:
+ *
+ * * REQ_SYNC: Passed down if the user bio is not yet completed, since it indicates the user bio
+ *   completion is required for further work to be done by the issuer.
+ * * REQ_META: Passed down if the user bio is not yet completed, since it may mean the lower layer
+ *   treats it as more urgent, similar to REQ_SYNC.
+ * * REQ_PRIO: Passed down if the user bio is not yet completed, since it indicates the user bio is
+ *   important.
+ * * REQ_NOMERGE: Set only if the incoming bio was split; irrelevant to VDO IO.
+ * * REQ_IDLE: Set if the incoming bio had more IO quickly following; VDO's IO pattern doesn't
+ *   match incoming IO, so this flag is incorrect for it.
+ * * REQ_FUA: Handled separately, and irrelevant to VDO IO otherwise.
+ * * REQ_RAHEAD: Passed down, as, for reads, it indicates trivial importance.
+ * * REQ_BACKGROUND: Not passed down, as VIOs are a limited resource and VDO needs them recycled
+ *   ASAP to service heavy load, which is the only place where REQ_BACKGROUND might aid in load
+ *   prioritization.

+/**
+ * DOC:
+ *
+ * The data_vio_pool maintains the pool of data_vios which a vdo uses to service incoming bios. For
+ * correctness, and in order to avoid potentially expensive or blocking memory allocations during
+ * normal operation, the number of concurrently active data_vios is capped. Furthermore, in order
+ * to avoid starvation of reads and writes, at most 75% of the data_vios may be used for
+ * discards. The data_vio_pool is responsible for enforcing these limits. Threads submitting bios
+ * for which a data_vio or discard permit are not available will block until the necessary
+ * resources are available. The pool is also responsible for distributing resources to blocked
+ * threads and waking them. Finally, the pool attempts to batch the work of recycling data_vios by
+ * performing the work of actually assigning resources to blocked threads or placing data_vios back
+ * into the pool on a single cpu at a time.
+ *
+ * The pool contains two "limiters", one for tracking data_vios and one for tracking discard
+ * permits. The limiters also provide safe cross-thread access to pool statistics without the need
+ * to take the pool's lock. When a thread submits a bio to a vdo device, it will first attempt to
+ * get a discard permit if it is a discard, and then to get a data_vio. If the necessary resources
+ * are available, the incoming bio will be assigned to the acquired data_vio, and it will be
+ * launched. However, if either of these are unavailable, the arrival time of the bio is recorded
+ * in the bio's bi_private field, the bio and its submitter are both queued on the appropriate
+ * limiter and the submitting thread will then put itself to sleep. (note that this mechanism will
+ * break if jiffies are only 32 bits.)
+ *
+ * Whenever a data_vio has completed processing for the bio it was servicing, release_data_vio()
+ * will be called on it. This function will add the data_vio to a funnel queue, and then check the
+ * state of the pool. If the pool is not currently processing released data_vios, the pool's
+ * completion will be enqueued on a cpu queue. This obviates the need for the releasing threads to
+ * hold the pool's lock, and also batches release work while avoiding starvation of the cpu
+ * threads.
+ *
+ * Whenever the pool's completion is run on a cpu thread, it calls process_release_callback() which
+ * processes a batch of returned data_vios (currently at most 32) from the pool's funnel queue. For
+ * each data_vio, it first checks whether that data_vio was processing a discard. If so, and there
+ * is a blocked bio waiting for a discard permit, that permit is notionally transferred to the
+ * eldest discard waiter, and that waiter is moved to the end of the list of discard bios waiting
+ * for a data_vio. If there are no discard waiters, the discard permit is returned to the pool.
+ * Next, the data_vio is assigned to the oldest blocked bio which either has a discard permit, or
+ * doesn't need one and relaunched. If neither of these exist, the data_vio is returned to the
+ * pool. Finally, if any waiting bios were launched, the threads which blocked trying to submit
+ * them are awakened.
