PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY isn't used in RDMA driver, so RDMA NIC uses non-managed
irq.

As I explained, this patchset doesn't rely on that interrupts have to
be fired on hctx->cpumask, and it only changes the submission io path,
which is blk-mq's generic code path which doesn't depend on any driver's
specific behavior.

Please let us know if your concerns are addressed.
