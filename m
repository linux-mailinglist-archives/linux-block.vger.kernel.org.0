For patches 1-10.
[x] eye checked the changes
[x] bloat-o-meter and .s diff show no real changes
[x] tested that kernel builds after every patch
[x] floppy targeted fuzzing with kasan+ubsan reveals no *new* issues
    (required mainly to test the previous patch)

If Linus has no objections (regarding his review) I would prefer to
accept 1-10 patches rather to resend them again. They seems complete
to me as the first step.

I've placed the patches here:
https://github.com/evdenis/linux-floppy/commits/floppy-next

Thanks,
Denis
