What do you mean by making it independent?

The patch does not depend on the zram changes, and so, this can
be merged separately as-is.

If you mean that I should not mention zram on the commit log, please
let me know. I however think a concrete example is useful.

Or do you just mean that I should resend this out as a new patch
without it being attached to the zram thread?

 Luis
