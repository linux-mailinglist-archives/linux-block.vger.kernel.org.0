Yes, these use-cases share characteristics. I'm not at all opposed to
placing this in the core. I do think that in order to put something like
this in the core, the bar needs to be higher such that an optimization
target cannot be biased towards a workload (i.e. needs to be adaptive).

I'm still not sure how we would build this on top of what we already
have as it is really centered around device being busy (which is not
the case for nvme), but I didn't put enough thought into it yet.
