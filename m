I was hoping the HPB guys would do this.  I think I know how to do it
based on my investigations, but I'd really prefer that someone who
cares about HPB did it.  It looks like a fairly simple excision, so I
think we can have this done before the end of the week and if it isn't
we could revert the whole driver.

Agreed, that was my initial proposed solution: get rid of the write
buffer optimzation now to fix the API abuse and see if we can add it
back in a more acceptable form later.
