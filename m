I think it is fine to move it to tag_set, this way could simplify a
lot.

The effect could be that blk_mq_quiesce_queue() becomes a little
slow, but it is always in slow path, and synchronize_srcu() won't
wait new read-side critical-section.

Just one corner case, in case of BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING, is there any such driver
which may block too long in ->queue_rq() sometime? such as wait for dozens
of seconds.
