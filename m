... begging the question why he relented for network namespaces.
They _do_ modify sysfs, and that via generic hooks (ie making struct
class namespace-aware).
And as this is a public interface I don't see why I can't be using it...

Guess with whom I'm discussing on how to implement this.

Which is my assumption, too. I have just mentioned it here for
completeness sake. It's not that I'll be implementing it for now.

Primarily because device-group is really limited in its functionality,
and the interface into the device core is, quite frankly, horrible.
(Implementing it under security/device_cgroup.c, and having direct
function calls from fs/block_dev.c and fs/namei.c?
hch will yet at me if I attempted that.)

Re-implementing that as a namespace is the cleaner solution.
Actually, it should be possible to re-implementing device-cgroup on to
of the block namespaces; for that we'll have to expand it to cover all
devices, but you're arguing for that anyway.
So, let's see.

Cheers,

Hannes
