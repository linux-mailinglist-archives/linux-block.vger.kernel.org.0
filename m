IMO, the cost for accessing one bit and one word is basically same.

That looks true.

However, in case of MQ, the normal code path is direct issue, not sure if
we need this kind of optimization.

BTW, no matter if hostwide tags is used or not, the problem is in always
run-queue from scsi_end_request(). As we discussed, the re-run queue is
only needed in case of budget contention.
