    Based on patch that was proposed upstream but ultimately rejected, see:
    https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-block/msg57490.html
    
    I'd have made this change even if this wasn't already posted obviously,
    but I figured I'd give proper attribution due to their public post with
    the same code change.

        nvme: allow retry for requests with REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT set
    
        REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT may be designed for SCSI, because SCSI protocol
        does not define the local retry mechanism. SCSI implements a fuzzy
        local retry mechanism, so REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT is needed to allow
        higher-level multipathing software to perform failover/retry.
    
        NVMe is different with SCSI about this. It defines a local retry
        mechanism and path error codes, so NVMe should retry local for non
        path error.  If path related error, whether to retry and how to retry
        is still determined by higher-level multipathing's failover.
    
        Unlike SCSI, NVMe shouldn't prevent retry if REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT
        because NVMe's local retry is needed -- as is NVMe specific logic to
        categorize whether an error is path related.
    
        In this way, the mechanism of NVMe multipath or other multipath are
        now equivalent.  The mechanism is: non path related error will be
        retry local, path related error is handled by multipath.
