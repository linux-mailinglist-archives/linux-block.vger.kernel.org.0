That would move more code into the freeze protection.  Including lo_mutex
which elsewhere is taken outside blk_freeze_queue.  The lo_mutex
acquisition is only for an assert, so we could skip that, so maybe we
can get there.  But the next patch adds another check for the release
flag so it doesn't seem worth it at this moment.
