Hi Eric,

The results are particularly interesting if you think a sync is not 
happening. There should not be any performance regression in this case 
between the two directories. I can try some reading/writing performance 
tests rather than creating files testing.

I did correctness test as part of manual tests by diffing the content of 
the copied files and verifying them. I did not run any other tests you 
mentioned. Feel free to add my Tested-by in the next version you send out.
