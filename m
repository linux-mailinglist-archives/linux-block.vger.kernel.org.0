>>If we ignore the RAID controller use case where the controller

These controllers should not be "ignored", but rather enabled. Many of them visualize both HDD and NVMe devices behind them, and thus forced to expose themselves as SCSI controllers.
However, they have their own queue management and IO merging capabilities. Many have capability of holding IO in queue and pull them as needed (just like NVMe), and thus does not bother if many IOs to a device or controller is sent or if there is congestion. In case of congestion, the IO will simply wait in queue, along with advanced timeout handling capabilities.
Besides, as Ming pointed out, Block layer (function hctx_may_queue) already limits IO on a per controller and per LUN basis.

Overall, if the proposal does not work for all cases, then at least it should be made optional for high end controller, so that they are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis NVMe, just because they expose themselves as SCSI in order to support a wide range of devices behind them.

thanks,
Sumanesh
