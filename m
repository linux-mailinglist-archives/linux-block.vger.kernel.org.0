Hi Jens,

This patch series improves small write IOPS by a factor of two for zoned =
UFS
devices on my test setup. The changes included in this patch series are a=
s
follows:
 - A new request queue limits flag is introduced that allows block driver=
s to
   declare whether or not they preserve the request order per hardware qu=
eue.
 - The order of zoned writes is preserved in the block layer by submittin=
g all
   zoned writes from the same CPU core as long as any zoned writes are pe=
nding.
   A new member 'from_cpu' is introduced in the per-zone data structure
   'blk_zone_wplug' to track from which CPU to submit zoned writes. This =
data
   member is reset to -1 after all pending zoned writes for a zone have
   completed.
 - The retry count for zoned writes is increased in the SCSI core to deal=
 with
   reordering caused by unit attention conditions or the SCSI error handl=
er.
 - New functionality is added in the null_blk and scsi_debug drivers to
   make it easier to test the changes introduced by this patch series.

Please consider this patch series for the next merge window.

Thanks,

Bart.

Changes compared to v17:
 - Rebased the patch series on top of kernel v6.16-rc1.
 - Dropped support for UFSHCI 3.0 controllers because the UFSHCI 3.0 auto=
-
   hibernation mechanism causes request reordering. UFSHCI 4.0 controller=
s
   remain supported.
 - Removed the error handling and write pointer tracking mechanisms again
   from block/blk-zoned.c.
 - Dropped the dm-linear patch from this patch series since I'm not aware=
 of
   any use cases for write pipelining and dm-linear.

Changes compared to v16:
 - Rebased the entire patch series on top of Jens' for-next branch. Compa=
red
   to when v16 of this series was posted, the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDA=
TE
   flag has been introduced and support for REQ_NOWAIT has been fixed.
 - The behavior for SMR disks is preserved: if .driver_preserves_write_or=
der
   has not been set, BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE is still set if a writ=
e
   error has been encountered. If .driver_preserves_write_order has not b=
een
   set, the write pointer is restored and the failed zoned writes are ret=
ried.
 - The superfluous "disk->zone_wplugs_hash_bits !=3D 0" tests have been r=
emoved.

Changes compared to v15:
 - Reworked this patch series on top of the zone write plugging approach.
 - Moved support for requeuing requests from the SCSI core into the block
   layer core.
 - In the UFS driver, instead of disabling write pipelining if
   auto-hibernation is enabled, rely on the requeuing mechanism to handle
   reordering caused by resuming from auto-hibernation.

Changes compared to v14:
 - Removed the drivers/scsi/Kconfig.kunit and drivers/scsi/Makefile.kunit
   files. Instead, modified drivers/scsi/Kconfig and added #include "*_te=
st.c"
   directives in the appropriate .c files. Removed the EXPORT_SYMBOL()
   directives that were added to make the unit tests link.
 - Fixed a double free in a unit test.

Changes compared to v13:
 - Reworked patch "block: Preserve the order of requeued zoned writes".
 - Addressed a performance concern by removing the eh_needs_prepare_resub=
mit
   SCSI driver callback and by introducing the SCSI host template flag
   .needs_prepare_resubmit instead.
 - Added a patch that adds a 'host' argument to scsi_eh_flush_done_q().
 - Made the code in unit tests less repetitive.

Changes compared to v12:
 - Added two new patches: "block: Preserve the order of requeued zoned wr=
ites"
   and "scsi: sd: Add a unit test for sd_cmp_sector()"
 - Restricted the number of zoned write retries. To my surprise I had to =
add
   "&& scmd->retries <=3D scmd->allowed" in the SCSI error handler to lim=
it the
   number of retries.
 - In patch "scsi: ufs: Inform the block layer about write ordering", onl=
y set
   ELEVATOR_F_ZBD_SEQ_WRITE for zoned block devices.

Changes compared to v11:
 - Fixed a NULL pointer dereference that happened when booting from an AT=
A
   device by adding an scmd->device !=3D NULL check in scsi_needs_prepara=
tion().
 - Updated Reviewed-by tags.

Changes compared to v10:
 - Dropped the UFS MediaTek and HiSilicon patches because these are not c=
orrect
   and because it is safe to drop these patches.
 - Updated Acked-by / Reviewed-by tags.

Changes compared to v9:
 - Introduced an additional scsi_driver callback: .eh_needs_prepare_resub=
mit().
 - Renamed the scsi_debug kernel module parameter 'no_zone_write_lock' in=
to
   'preserves_write_order'.
 - Fixed an out-of-bounds access in the unit scsi_call_prepare_resubmit()=
 unit
   test.
 - Wrapped ufshcd_auto_hibern8_update() calls in UFS host drivers with
   WARN_ON_ONCE() such that a kernel stack appears in case an error code =
is
   returned.
 - Elaborated a comment in the UFSHCI driver.

Changes compared to v8:
 - Fixed handling of 'driver_preserves_write_order' and 'use_zone_write_l=
ock'
   in blk_stack_limits().
 - Added a comment in disk_set_zoned().
 - Modified blk_req_needs_zone_write_lock() such that it returns false if
   q->limits.use_zone_write_lock is false.
 - Modified disk_clear_zone_settings() such that it clears
   q->limits.use_zone_write_lock.
 - Left out one change from the mq-deadline patch that became superfluous=
 due to
   the blk_req_needs_zone_write_lock() change.
 - Modified scsi_call_prepare_resubmit() such that it only calls list_sor=
t() if
   zoned writes have to be resubmitted for which zone write locking is di=
sabled.
 - Added an additional unit test for scsi_call_prepare_resubmit().
 - Modified the sorting code in the sd driver such that only those SCSI c=
ommands
   are sorted for which write locking is disabled.
 - Modified sd_zbc.c such that ELEVATOR_F_ZBD_SEQ_WRITE is only set if th=
e
   write order is not preserved.
 - Included three patches for UFS host drivers that rework code that wrot=
e
   directly to the auto-hibernation controller register.
 - Modified the UFS driver such that enabling auto-hibernation is not all=
owed
   if a zoned logical unit is present and if the controller operates in l=
egacy
   mode.
 - Also in the UFS driver, simplified ufshcd_auto_hibern8_update().

Changes compared to v7:
 - Split the queue_limits member variable `use_zone_write_lock' into two =
member
   variables: `use_zone_write_lock' (set by disk_set_zoned()) and
   `driver_preserves_write_order' (set by the block driver or SCSI LLD). =
This
   should clear up the confusion about the purpose of this variable.
 - Moved the code for sorting SCSI commands by LBA from the SCSI error ha=
ndler
   into the SCSI disk (sd) driver as requested by Christoph.
  =20
Changes compared to v6:
 - Removed QUEUE_FLAG_NO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCK and instead introduced a flag in
   the request queue limits data structure.

Changes compared to v5:
 - Renamed scsi_cmp_lba() into scsi_cmp_sector().
 - Improved several source code comments.

Changes compared to v4:
 - Dropped the patch that introduces the REQ_NO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCK flag.
 - Dropped the null_blk patch and added two scsi_debug patches instead.
 - Dropped the f2fs patch.
 - Split the patch for the UFS driver into two patches.
 - Modified several patch descriptions and source code comments.
 - Renamed dd_use_write_locking() into dd_use_zone_write_locking().
 - Moved the list_sort() call from scsi_unjam_host() into scsi_eh_flush_d=
one_q()
   such that sorting happens just before reinserting.
 - Removed the scsi_cmd_retry_allowed() call from scsi_check_sense() to m=
ake
   sure that the retry counter is adjusted once per retry instead of twic=
e.

Changes compared to v3:
 - Restored the patch that introduces QUEUE_FLAG_NO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCK. That=
 patch
   had accidentally been left out from v2.
 - In patch "block: Introduce the flag REQ_NO_ZONE_WRITE_LOCK", improved =
the
   patch description and added the function blk_no_zone_write_lock().
 - In patch "block/mq-deadline: Only use zone locking if necessary", move=
d the
   blk_queue_is_zoned() call into dd_use_write_locking().
 - In patch "fs/f2fs: Disable zone write locking", set REQ_NO_ZONE_WRITE_=
LOCK
   from inside __bio_alloc() instead of in f2fs_submit_write_bio().

Changes compared to v2:
 - Renamed the request queue flag for disabling zone write locking.
 - Introduced a new request flag for disabling zone write locking.
 - Modified the mq-deadline scheduler such that zone write locking is onl=
y
   disabled if both flags are set.
 - Added an F2FS patch that sets the request flag for disabling zone writ=
e
   locking.
 - Only disable zone write locking in the UFS driver if auto-hibernation =
is
   disabled.

Changes compared to v1:
 - Left out the patches that are already upstream.
 - Switched the approach in patch "scsi: Retry unaligned zoned writes" fr=
om
   retrying immediately to sending unaligned write commands to the SCSI e=
rror
   handler.
