With the above 2 steps, we have same timeout action in following three case:
A. connections > 1
B. connections ==1 && tag_set.timeout > 0
C. connections ==1 && tag_set.timeout = 0
In all above case, socket is marked dead if needed. Request is requeued.
This also means that if timeout is set to 0 by user space, it will not
have any effect.

This looks good only except that the behavior of case C is not same as before.
(Before we wait until the request is completed. Now wait at most
dead_conn_timeout)
I am not sure if any user space tools relay on it.

I'd like to say that I prefer this way than reseting timer until the
request is completed.
But for now it might be better to keep the behavior same with before.
So I'd like to suggest that we fix reconnection in case B and C with
current patches if you agree.

Thanks.

I was trying to keep the behavior of timeout=0 same as before, with
the difference
of only requeue the cmd if needed. I currently do not configure timeout to 0
in our environment.

Please see above.

Thanks and Regards
