IIUC, the behind bio is allocated from bio_set (mddev->bio_set) which is 
allocated in md_run by
call bioset_init, so the mempool (bvec_pool) of  this bio_set is created 
by biovec_init_pool which
uses global biovec slabs. Do we really need another mempool? Or, there 
is no potential deadlock
  for this case.

Thanks for the above, will copy it accordingly. I will check if 
WriteMostly is set before, then check both
the flag and bitmap.

Agree.

Thanks for deeper looking! I guess it is because how vcnt is calculated.

The path (blk_queue_split -> blk_bio_segment_split -> bvec_split_segs) 
which respects max_segments
of limit. Do you mean introduce max_single_page_bvec to limit? Then 
perform similar checking as for
  max_segment.

Thanks,
