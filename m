Well, the reason to do a kernel driver rather than a ublk back end
boils down to a few things:

 - writing highly concurrent code is actually a lot simpler in the kernel
   than in userspace because we have the right primitives for it
 - these primitives tend to actually be a lot faster than those available
   in glibc as well
 - the double context switch into the kernel and back for a ublk device
   backed by a file system will actually show up for some xfstests that
   do a lot of synchronous ops
 - having an in-tree kernel driver that you just configure / unconfigure
   from the shell is a lot easier to use than a daemon that needs to
   be running.  Especially from xfstests or other test suites that do
   a lot of per-test setup and teardown
 - the kernel actually has really nice infrastructure for block drivers.
   I'm pretty sure doing this in userspace would actually be more
   code, while being harder to use and lower performance.

So we could go both ways, but the kernel version was pretty obviously
the preferred one to me.  Maybe that's a little biasses by doing a lot
of kernel work, and having run into a lot of problems and performance
issues with the SCSI target user backend lately.
