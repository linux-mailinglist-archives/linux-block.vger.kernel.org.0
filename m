The basic issue I am trying to solve with NVMe/FC is that we cannot get sys=
tems
to boot reliably from NVMe/FC (boot from SAN) because we don't know how lon=
g
the connect is going to take, and we have seen spurious failures in our tes=
ting.

In general, I think the whole business of a userspace syscall() -> asynchro=
nous
work in the kernel is problematic because the syscall can return a good sta=
tus
even if the connect is never going to work due to a condition that is
not going to
clear.  It is difficult and cumbersome to script around this reliably.

So what I am saying is the current mechanism doesn't work completely
right anyway.

We also encounter the problem Daniel is addressing trying to get
blktests and other
internal tests to work, for similar reasons.
