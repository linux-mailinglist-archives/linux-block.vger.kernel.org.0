Thanks for testing this. This is odd because I tested with the setup you
provided.

I used the kernel config you sent to me in [2] with an xfs root device
with direct kernel boot and the following xfstests config in [3]. I'm
booting the vm with:

qemu-system-x86_64 -machine type=q35 -smp 1 -m 4G -accel kvm -cpu max -nographic -nodefaults \
        -chardev stdio,mux=on,id=console,signal=off -serial chardev:console -mon console \
        -kernel /home/ubuntu/data/mkosi-kernel2/mkosi.output.debian/image.vmlinuz \
        -drive file=/home/ubuntu/data/mkosi-kernel2/mkosi.output.debian/image.raw,format=raw,if=virtio \
        -append "console=ttyS0 root=/dev/vda2 module_blacklist=vmw_vmci systemd.tty.term.ttyS0=screen-256color systemd.tty.columns.ttyS0=96 systemd.tty.rows.ttyS0=46 debug loglevel=4 SYSTEMD_"

Note that the config you gave me in [2] didn't include
CONFIG_SCSI_VIRTIO=y which means I got the splat you did. I added this
missing config option and everything worked fine for me.

Can you please test what's in the vfs.fixes branch on
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/vfs/vfs.git so we're
sure that we're testing the same thing?

The failures that I see are:

Failures: generic/042 generic/645 generic/682 generic/689 xfs/014
xfs/017 xfs/049 xfs/129 xfs/176 xfs/206 xfs/216 xfs/234 xfs/250 xfs/289
xfs/558 xfs/559
Failed 16 of 930 tests

* generic/645 fails because it requires an unrelated fix to fstests
  because we changed idmapped mounts to not not allow empty idmappings.
* generic/689 fails because the providec config doesn't compile tmpfs with POSIX ACL support
* xfs/558 and xfs/559 complain about missing logging
  about iomap validation and are unrelated
* All other failures are caused by loop devices which is expected unil
  a util-linux is released that contains Jan's fix in [1] so that
  mount(8) doesn't hold a writable fd to the loop device anymore and
  instead simply uses a read-only one.
