Thanks for the notice and the references. What's your version of
util-linux? What your test script does is indeed racy. You have there:

echo Running:
for i in {a..z}{a..z}; do
    mount $i.squash /mnt/$i &
done

So all mount(8) commands will run in parallel and race to setup loop
devices with LOOP_SET_FD and mount them. However util-linux (at least in
the current version) seems to handle EBUSY from LOOP_SET_FD just fine and
retries with the new loop device. So at this point I don't see why the patch
makes difference... I guess I'll need to reproduce and see what's going on
in detail.
