Oh please, can we skip the empty words, this is tiresome and
unproductive. Since you apparently have a much better grasp on this than
I do, answer me this:

1) How many users of ataflop are there?

2) How big of a subset of that group are capable of figuring out where
   to send a bug report?

By your reasoning, any bug would go unreported for years, no matter how
big the user group is. That is patently false. It's most commonly a
combination of how hard it is to hit, and how many can potentially hit
it. Yes, some people will work around a bug, but others will not. Hence
a subset of people that hit it will report it. Decades of bug reports
have proven this to be true on my end.

Nobody has reported the ataflop issue in 3 years. Either these people
never upgrade (which may be true), or none of them are using ataflop.
It's as simple as that.
