Uww, yes.  I suspect the best fix is to actually stop the kobject
from taking part in the md life time directly.  Because the kobject
contributes a reference to the disk until it is deleted, we might
as well stop messing with the refcounts entirely and just call
kobject_del on it just before del_gendisk.  Let me see what I can do
there.

Fixed.

Fixed.
