That is roughly the size of the disk that triggered my bug report from 
2012.

Bug 43511 - Partitions: Amiga RDB partition on 2 TB disk way too big, 
while OK in AmigaOS 4.1

I don't know about "-1" for end of partition list. However, on reviewing 
my bug report I think I used Media Toolbox myself to create the 
partition table. However I am not completely sure about that. It has 
been a long time. I used Media Toolbox on AmigaOS 4.1 to extract the 
binary copy of the RDB, but I do not recall what I used to partition it. 
I bet it was Media Toolbox as well, likely on some development version 
of AmigaOS 4. I was member of the AmigaOS 4 team back then. The disk is 
repartitioned as GPT and I do not even know at the moment where it is. 
So that is all I can say.

I could ask someone from the AmigaOS 4 team, however I am not a member 
of it anymore. And in any case, whether Media Toolbox or another tool 
writes a "-1" to end partition list or not, I'd not treat a signed value 
"-1" as valid partition size. We could also ask Joanne again, however 
she was not involved in AmigaOS 4 development and does not know about 
Media Toolbox. She created the "hdwrench.library" for AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 
HDToolBox. So maybe it is just good to assume "-1" as end of partition 
table, at least after confirming from the binary of the affected RDB that 
the "-1" is indeed at the end of the partition block list. Maybe also in 
the RDB from my bug report there is this "-1" again… however, the disk 
worked okay in Linux after testing with Joanne's initial patch from

This comment from an AmigaOS developer is only about the maximum sizes 
and does not detail a "-1" as partition size – however I did not ask 
about it back then:

It is in the first attachment of the bug report I mentioned above. The 
bug the patch fixed.

In the bug report I wrote:

"I had a BTRFS filesystem that had some checksum errors. Maybe thats 
somehow related to this issue and AmigaOS and/or Linux overwrote 
something it shouldn´t have touched."

(Meanwhile I bet it is safe to assume that in case the checksum error 
was from overwriting something it was not AmigaOS 4.)

This is no proof, but as I re-read my bug report: It is clearly an 
overflow issue worsened by Linux back then truncating the too high 
partition sizes larger than the disk to the disk size instead of bailing 
out. So the partition I created for the Linux LVM in front of the Amiga 
partitions overflowed into the Amiga partitions. Had I used that place 
inside the PV for any LV and written to it… I bet it would have been 
goodbye to the Amiga data.

I think the patch series has been very well reviewed, but I would not 
have spotted such an issue as I am not really an RDB expert and even 
then, with all the big endian conversions and what not inside of there… 
In my understanding the RDB format is not really as Rigid as the name 
implies. It is quite flexible, especially when compared to what had been 
used on PC back then and sometimes even now. So there is a chance for a 
RDB partitioning that triggers an oversight in the patch series.

Makes sense to me.
