Okay.

So, the issue we see for CMD6 with R1, is a software problem that we
should be able to fix.

Okay, I see.

Alright, that sounds great!

I understand that 11s is probably fine to use, for most cases.

However, it's not spec compliant, as for some operations there are
simply no timeout specified. BKOPS, cache flush, sanitize are cases
like this - and then 11s is definitely not sufficient.

Thanks!

I would like to get the regression fixed asap, but I also would like
to avoid reverting patches, unless really necessary. May I propose the
following two options.

1. Find out why polling with ->card_busy() or CMD13, for a CMD6 with
an R1 response doesn't work - and then fix that behaviour.

2. Set the mmc->max_busy_timeout to zero for sdhci-tegra, which makes
the core to always use R1B for CMD6 (and erase). This also means that
when the cmd->busy_timeout becomes longer than 11s, sdhci-tegra must
disable the HW busy timeout and just wait "forever".

If you decide for 2, you can add the software timeout support on top,
but make that can be considered as a next step of an improvement,
rather than needed as fix. Note that, I believe there are some support
for software timeout already in the sdhci core, maybe you need to
tweak it a bit for your case, I don't know.

Kind regards
Uffe
