Hi Ming,

Your email triggered a memory of someone else (Konstantin Khlebnikov)
having reported and fixed this relatively recently, please see this
patchset: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/2/336

Obviously this needs fixing.  If you have time to review/polish the
proposed patches that'd be great.

Mike
