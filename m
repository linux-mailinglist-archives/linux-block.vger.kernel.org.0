I suppose the first question is "why block only?"  There are several
existing device namespace proposals which would be more generic.

We actually already have a devices cgroup that does some of this:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/devices.txt

However, visibility isn't the only problem, for direct passthrough
there's also uevent handling and people have even asked about module
loading.

I really wouldn't do this.  Namespace/Cgroup separation should be kept
as high as possible.  If it leaks into the drivers it will become
unmaintainable.  Why do you think you need the drivers to be aware?  If
it's just enumeration, that should all be doable with the visibility
driver unless you want to do things like compact numbering?

First question is does the device cgroup do enough for you and if not
what's missing?
