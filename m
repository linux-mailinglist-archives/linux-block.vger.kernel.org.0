To be a bit more concrete, FMP (Flash Memory Protector) on Exynos SoCs is an
example of hardware that supports inline encryption without having the concept
of keyslots.  On that hardware, each request takes an actual key, rather than a
keyslot number.  Likewise, some Mediatek SoCs are like this too.

So support for inline encryption without keyslots is something that is useful
for real hardware, in addition to the device-mapper support which is the initial
use case included in this patchset.

Generally looks good, feel free to add:

	Reviewed-by: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

However, maybe it's worth reconsidering the suggestion I've made previously
(https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-block/20200326062213.GF858@sol.localdomain) of
separating the crypto capabilities from the keyslot manager.  If we did that,
then this case could be handled by a NULL keyslot manager, rather than a special
kind of keyslot manager that doesn't actually do the keyslot management.

I realize that it's a bit tricky because the key eviction callback would still
be needed.  So maybe it's not really better.  Also, previously other people have
seemed to prefer just the keyslot manager, e.g.
https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-block/20200327170047.GA24682@infradead.org.

Does anyone have any new thoughts on this?

Also, a couple minor comments below.

I think the above WARN_ON() should just be removed:

	if (blk_ksm_is_passthrough(ksm))
		return;

Otherwise callers might need to conditionally call blk_ksm_reprogram_all_keys()
depending on whether there are keyslots or not.

Maybe:

"inline encryption hardware that don't have a small fixed number of keyslots"

=>

"inline encryption hardware that doesn't have the concept of keyslots"
