Regarding the following part of patch 07/14:

-		disk_zone_wplug_abort(zwplug);
-		zwplug->flags |= BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE;
+		if (!disk->queue->limits.driver_preserves_write_order)
+			zwplug->flags |= BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE;
+		zwplug->flags |= BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_ERROR;

How about setting BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_ERROR only if
disk->queue->limits.driver_preserves_write_order has been set such that
the restored error handling code is only used if the storage controller
preserves the write order? This should be sufficient to preserve the
existing behavior of the blk-zoned.c code for SMR disks.

The reason I restored the error handling code is that the code in 
blk-zoned.c does not support error handling inside block drivers if QD > 1
and because supporting the SCSI error handler is essential for UFS
devices.

I only expect requeues to happen in exceptional cases, e.g. because the
SCSI error handler has been activated or because a SCSI device reports a 
unit attention. Requeues may happen in any order so I think that it is
essential to pause request submission after a requeue until all pending
zoned writes for the same zone have completed or failed.

That's an interesting proposal. I will look into setting the WP to the
lowest sector of all requeued requests.

> No need for re-introducing all the error handling for that, no ?

The error handling code has been restored because of another reason,
namely to support the SCSI error handler in case the queue depth is
larger than one.

I will include a more detailed cover letter when I repost this series
(after the merge window has closed). While I work on this, feedback on
this version of this patch series is still welcome.

Thanks,

Bart.
