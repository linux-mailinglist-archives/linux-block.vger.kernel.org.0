get_util_irq() only works in case of HAVE_SCHED_AVG_IRQ which depends
on IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING or PARAVIRT_TIME_ACCOUNTING.

Also rq->avg_irq.util_avg is only updated when there is scheduler
activities. However, when interrupt flood happens, scheduler can't
have chance to be called. Looks get_util_irq() can't be relied on
for this task.

Actually this issue should be more serious on ARM64 system, in which
there are more CPU cores, and each CPU core is often slower than
x86's, and each interrupt is only delivered to single CPU target.

Meantime the storage device performance is same for the two kinds of
systems.
