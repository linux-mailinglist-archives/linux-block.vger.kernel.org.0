Jens patch using need_resched() looks improving the situation, also the
scsi_debug case won't set BLOCKING:

1) without the patch, it can be easy to trigger lockup with the
following test.

- modprobe scsi_debug virtual_gb=128 delay=0 dev_size_mb=2048
- fio --bs=512k --ioengine=sync --iodepth=128 --numjobs=4 --rw=randrw \
	--name=sdc-sync-randrw-512k --filename=/dev/sdc --direct=1 --size=60G --runtime=120

#sdc is the created scsi_debug disk

2) with the patch, lockup still can be triggered, just not as easy as
before

3) trace need_resched() from kretprobe:__blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() in
kblockd wq context, I observed that just 20~30 times resched gets set
when running the above script(120sec), so maybe need_resched() isn't set
during heavy IO dispatching.


Thanks,
Ming
