I will make the commit message more detailed.

Incorrect data transfers have been observed in our tests. We noticed in 
our tests with the Exynos controller and PAGE_SIZE = 16 KiB that booting 
fails without this patch series. I think booting failed because the DMA 
engine in this controller was asked to perform transfers that fall 
outside the supported limits. I expect similar behavior for all other 
storage controllers with a DMA engine.

Bart.
