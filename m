Do you mean the queue freezing is called in the following code snippet?

```
static ssize_t queue_poll_store(struct request_queue *q, const char
*page, size_t count)
{
	...
	if (poll_on) {
		blk_queue_flag_set(QUEUE_FLAG_POLL, q);
	} else {
		blk_mq_freeze_queue(q);
		blk_queue_flag_clear(QUEUE_FLAG_POLL, q);
		blk_mq_unfreeze_queue(q);
	}
```

And I can't understand how bio-based queue doesn't support queue freezing.

```
submit_bio_noacct
	__submit_bio_noacct
		bio_queue_enter
```

Every time submitting a bio, bio_queue_enter() will be called, and once
the queue has been frozen, bio_queue_enter() will wait there until the
queue is unfrozen.

Yes it still works. I agree if there's no better solution...

And what about the issue Christoph originally concerned? Do we use one
more flag bit indicating if the queue capable of polling, or the
poll_capable() method way?
