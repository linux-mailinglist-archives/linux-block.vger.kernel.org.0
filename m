I am wondering how you guarantee that context B is always run after
context A.

Another candidate approach is to run the following code before
releasing 'zone' lock:

	if (current->plug)
		blk_finish_plug(context->plug)

Then we can fix zone specific issue in zone code only, and avoid generic
blk-core change for zone issue.
