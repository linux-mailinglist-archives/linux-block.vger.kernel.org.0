I suspect that the first one is preferred, just as a "don't even have
to think about it" thing.

In general, despite my suggestion of maybe using upper-case to show
odd syntax (and I may have suggested it, but I really don't like how
it looks, so I'm not at all convinced it's a good idea), to a
first-order approximation the rule should be:

 - always use parentheses around macros

 - EXCEPT:
     - when used purely as arguments to functions or other macros
     - when there is some syntax reason why it's not ok to add parens

The "arguments to functions/macros" is because the comma separator
between arguments isn't even a operator (ie it is *not* a
comma-expression, it's multiple expressions separated by commas).
There is no "operator precedence" subtlety.

So we have a lot of macros that are just wrappers around functions (or
other macros), and in that situation you do *not* then add more
parentheses, and doing something like

    #define update_screen(x) redraw_screen(x, 0)

is fine, and might even be preferred syntax because putting
parentheses around 'x' not only doesn't buy you anything, but just
makes things uglier.

And the "syntax reasons" can be due to the usual things: we not only
have that 'pass member name around' issue, but we have things like
string expansion etc, where adding parentheses anywhere to things like

    #define __stringify_1(x...)     #x
    #define __stringify(x...)       __stringify_1(x)

would obviously simply not work (or look at our "SYSCALL_DEFINEx()"
games for more complex examples with many layers of token pasting
etc).

But in general I would suggest against "this is the lowest priority
operator" kind of games. Nobody remembers the exact operator
precedence so well that they don't have to think about it.

So for example, we have

    #define scr_writew(val, addr) (*(addr) =3D (val))

to pick another VT example, and I think that's right both for 'addr'
(that requires the parentheses) and for 'val' (that might not require
it, but let's not make people think about it).
