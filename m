Hi,
sorry for the delay and that you very much for reporting this crash.
I have prepared a dev version of BFQ, to try to solve this problem.
It's based on a 5.12.0, and should hopefully provide more information
upon failure.  Could you please give it a try?  You can find it here:
https://github.com/Algodev-github/bfq-mq/tree/dev-bfq-on-5.12

Thanks for your help,
Paolo
