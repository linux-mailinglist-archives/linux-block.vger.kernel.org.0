Thanks. I will be more careful about this. I'm gonna set related 
constraint in my vim, checkpatch etc. ;)

Actually why I didn't choose 'BIO_SPLIT' at the very beginning is that, 
currently only normal IO in mq routine gets marked when they gets split, 
neither abnormal IO nor normal IO in dm/md routine, though this is 
reasonable since currently only normal IO in mq routine is capable of 
polling and gets stuck in this issue.

But BIO_SPLIT may be more clear? I could explain the above constraint in 
the comment instead.


Thanks for reviewing.
