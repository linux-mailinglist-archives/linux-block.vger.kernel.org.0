Ming -

After going through your comment (I noted your comment and thanks for
correcting my understanding.) and block layer code, I realize that it is a
different race condition. My previous explanation was not accurate.
I debug further and figure out what is actually happening - Consider below
scenario/sequence -

Thread -1 - Detected budget contention. Set restarts = 1.
Thread -2 - old restarts = 1. start hw queue.
Thread -3 - old restarts = 1. start hw queue.
Thread -2 - move restarts = 0.
In my testing, I noticed that both thread-2 and thread-3 started h/w queue
but there was no work for them to do. It is possible because some other
context of h/w queue run might have done that job.
It means, IO of thread-1 is already posted.
Thread -4 - Detected budget contention. Set restart = 1 (because thread-2
has move restarts=0).
Thread -3 - move restarts = 0 (because this thread see old value = 1 but
that is actually updated one more time by thread-4 and theread-4 actually
wanted to run h/w queues). IO of Thread-4 will not be scheduled.

We have to make sure that completion IO path do atomic_cmpxchng of
restarts flag before running the h/w queue.  Below code change - (main fix
is sequence of atomic_cmpxchg and blk_mq_run_hw_queues) fix the issue.
