Yeah, we have to rebase V6 against Christoph's patchset anyway.

Looks there is at least two approaches left for us:

1) keep the generic approach in V6, just rebase after Christoph's patch
is finalized

2) support io polling simply in bio driver, since bio->bi_cookie is
assigned for underlying bio, and it shouldn't be very difficult to
support that in DM/MD. I have been thinking of it a while, but not
coding it yet. BTW, all underlying bios can be linked to DM
bio->bi_next, and we can add one new callback of .io_poll for polling
DM/MD's bio.


Thanks,
Ming
