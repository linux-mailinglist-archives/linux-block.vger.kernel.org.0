No, it supports any mapping, but the issue won't be triggered on 1:N
mapping, since this kind of hctx never becomes inactive.

It doesn't matter, see blew comment.

The patchset actually doesn't bind to interrupt vector, and that said we
don't care actuall interrupt allocation.

No, one hctx only becomes inactive after each CPU in hctx->cpumask is offline.
No matter how interrupt vector is assigned to hctx, requests shouldn't
be dispatched to that hctx any more.
