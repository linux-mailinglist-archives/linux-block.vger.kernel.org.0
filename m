I see. My understanding after some comments from Christoph was that we
should use these bits to signal any optional features / capabilities
that would depend on the underlying driver, just as it is done with the
capacity flag today.

If not for the offline transition, for the attributes, I see it exactly
as the same use case as capacity, where we signal that a new field is
reported in the report structure.

Am I missing something here?

I see. If we can reach an agreement that the above is a bad
understanding on my side, I will be happy to translate this into a sysfs
entry. If it is OK, I'll give it this week in the mailing list and send
a V4 next week.

Yes. As mentioned, I did not want to introduce more changes to this
series, just fix the mistake I made with some added debug code.
