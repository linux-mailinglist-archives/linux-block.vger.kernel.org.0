Curiously, we (as in we as SLES developers) have found just the opposite.
NVMe is a new technology, and out of necessity there will not be any 
existing installations where we have to be compatible with.
We have switched to native NVMe multipathing with SLE15, and decided to 
educate customers that NVMe is a different concept than SCSI, and one 
shouldn't try treat both the same way. This was helped by the fact the 
SLE15 is a new release, so customers were accustomed to having to change 
bits and pieces in their infrastructure to support new releases.

Overall it worked reasonably well; we sure found plenty of bugs, but 
that was kind of expected, and for bad or worse nearly all of them 
turned out to be upstream issues. Which was good for us (nothing beats 
being able to blame things on upstream, if one is careful to not linger 
too much on the fact that one is part of upstream); and upstream these 
things will need to be fixed anyway.
So we had a bit of a mixed experience, but customers seemed to be happy 
enough with this step.

Sorry about that :-)

Cheers,

Hannes
