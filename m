Martin:

(I forgot to ask this question several weeks ago, while you were running 
your tests.  Better ask it now before I forget again...)

I suspect the old runtime-PM code in the block layer would have worked 
okay in your SD cardreader test if the BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT flag had not 
been set.  Do you know why the flag was set, or what line of code caused 
it to be set?

As I recall, the request that failed was a read-ahead.  It's not clear 
to me why such a request would need to have BLK_MQ_REQ_PREEMPT set.  
Although there may be other reasons for having that flag, at this point 
we're concerned with requests that are part of the runtime-resume 
procedure.  A read-ahead does not fall into that category.

Do you think you can find the answer?  Perhaps we should add a separate 
BLK_MQ_REQ_PM flag.
