I think that is more resilient to doc updates (eg if the mention above
is removed, then there would be no link). Also the reader won't have to
search for a different, linked location of the same thing.

I usually copy-paste it into a temporary file and then format that
(removing the leading `//! `) the annoying thing is that you then want
to align it to 96 columns. The way I do it is by wrapping the code in a
`mod tmp {}`, since that introduces 4 additional spaces. I think you
could also directly do it in the file by just removing the prefix and
wrapping in a module.

Ah I forgot about this issue... You are absolutely correct that we do
not get the guarantee for `repr(Rust)`.

Well, my editor is configured to wrap at the 100th column including
comments. I don't know why we have so many comment blocks at 80 columns.

That makes sense. In that case, we could also probably add an additional
note to the function that the name might be a bit misleading. In the
sense that it sounds like "here is a request, please complete it"
instead of "here is a request that was just completed".

Thanks. I think that since the C side doesn't use ref-counting, the
lifecycle of a request is probably rather simple. Therefore we should
try to also avoid refcounting in Rust and see if we can eg tie ending
requests to the associated `TagSet` (ie require `&mut` on the tagset)
and tie accessing requests to shared access to the `TagSet`. Then we
would be able to avoid the refcount. But I will first have to take a
look at the nvme driver to gauge the plausibility.

I don't think the churn of the name change is worth it, so keep the

If you can just use the fetch_update function, then that would be better
than (almost) reimplementing it. But if you really need to get the new
value, then I guess it can't really be helped. (or do you think you can
just apply `op` to the old value returned by `fetch_update`?)

I think since it is not that expensive in this case, you should go for
the second approach.
We can fix it later, when we get the proper bindgen support.
