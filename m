Not only '->blkif', but 'be' itself also coule be a NULL.  As similar
concurrency issues could be in other drivers in their way, I suggest to change
the reclaim callback ('->reclaim_memory') to be called for each driver instead
of each device.  Then, each driver could be able to deal with its concurrency
issues by itself.

For blkback, we could reuse the global variable based approach, as similar to
the v7[1] of this patchset.  As the callback is called for each driver instead
of each device now, the duplicated set of the timeout will not happen.
