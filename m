Fine by me although I would note that e.g. most of our customer are running
on 4.4 or 4.12-based kernels so if any of them has their custom scripting
using blktrace API (I seriously doubt that though), they'll probably notice
the problem only in couple of years... But as I said I doubt there's
anybody doing this and blktrace is a debugging API so I'm fine with just
fixing blkparse and crossing my fingers ;) I'll send the patch after some
polishing (I just quickly hacked it up so that I can proceed with my
analysis).
