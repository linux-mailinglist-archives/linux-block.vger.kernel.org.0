The old batching and congestion was helpful for some slow devices, since
batching can avoid to submit IOs from different tasks concurrently to
same queue when queue is busy, so IO order in same task is maintained.

I believe Josh is struggling with this issue, and we had one offline

And there was another such old discussion too:
