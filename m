I looked at the last patch here and I really do not see the issue.

In order for the module to be removed, zram_exit() has to return, right?
And that function calls destroy_devices() which will then remove all
devices in sysfs that are associated with this driver.  At that point in
time, sysfs detaches the attributes from kernfs so that any open file
handle that happened to be around for an attribute file will not call
back into the show/store function for that device.

Then destroy_devices() returns, and zram_exit() returns, and the module
is unloaded.

So how can a show/store function in zram_drv.c be called after
destroy_devices() returns?

The changelog text in patch 4/4 is odd, destroy_devices() shouldn't be
racing with anything as devices have reference counts in order to
protect this type of thing from happening, right?  How can a store
function be called when a device is somehow removed from memory at the
same time?  Don't we properly incremement/decrement the device
structure's reference count?  If not, wouldn't that be the simplest
solution here?

And who is ripping out zram drivers while the system is running anyway?
What workflow causes this to happen so much so that the sysfs files need
to be "protected"?  What tool/script/whatever is hammering on those
sysfs files so much while someone wants to unload the module?

What am I missing?

thanks,
