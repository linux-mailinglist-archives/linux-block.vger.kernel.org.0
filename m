My name is Daniel M. Murdock, a citizen of Canada. I am a Contractor working here in the Middle East. I started working here after I lost my wife six years ago in a fatal auto accident.
I contacted you primarily in confidence hoping that you can be a trustworthy person to help me on self keep of 3.5 million Dollars and would also be helpful to me in this urgent matter like this.  
As i may trust you to receive my box that is with funds as  notorious terrorists operating in this part of Syria attacked our station and inflicted heavy injuries on our base in which I lost two of my colleagues.

Am waiting for your urgent  assistant for more information.
Daniel Murdock.
