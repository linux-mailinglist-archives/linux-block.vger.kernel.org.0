I looked at the virtio_blk driver and that seems to confirm it. There is no
use of the bio interface either, so I guess we should not pick up this
patch.

What do you think about the out-of-order execution? Would that make sense
to upstream it? Does it look reasonable?

Well, the problem here is that Oracle stopped working on Linux for SPARC
abruptly, so many of their improvements were never sent upstream and did
not see any reviews which would have caught this.

OK, so your opinion is then to add the patch that you proposed on top of wh=
at's
currently there in Linus' tree, meaning adding some code that will requeue =
requests
once the retry limit has been reached?

Can you maybe post a proper patch then which I (and others) could test and =
then
hopefully add their "Tested-by"?
