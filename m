OK, that's indeed a no-op for our floppy driver, which can queue
exactly one request.

I'm not averse to using bd->last to close down only after the last
request in a sequence if it can be done safely (i.e. the requests that
had been rejected are then promptly requeued). But complexity is the
enemy of maintainability, so the nice and easy fix should be enough.

I'll respin and send another version shortly.

Cheers,
