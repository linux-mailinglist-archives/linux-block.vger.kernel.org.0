Indeed, lo->lo_encryption is set to non-NULL by loop_init_xfer() after a refcount
is taken and lo->lo_encryption is reset to NULL by loop_release_xfer() before
that refount is dropped, and these operations are serialized by lo->lo_mutex. Then,
lo->lo_encryption == xfer can't happen unless forced module unload is requested.

That is, it seems that unregister_transfer_cb() is there in case forced module
unload of cryptoloop module was requested. And in that case, there is no point
with crashing the kernel via panic_on_warn == 1 && WARN_ON_ONCE(). Simple printk()
will be sufficient.

Removing unregister_transfer_cb() (if we ignore forced module unload) will be
a separate patch.

In order to annotate that extra operations that might sleep should not be
added inside this section. Use of sleepable locks tends to get extra
operations (e.g. wait for a different mutex / completion) and makes it unclear
what the lock is protecting. I can imagine a future that someone adds an
unwanted dependency inside this section if we use mutex here.

Technically, we can add preempt_diable() after mutex_lock() and
preempt_enable() before mutex_unlock() in order to annotate that
extra operations that might sleep should be avoided.
But idr_alloc(GFP_ATOMIC)/idr_find()/idr_for_each_entry() etc. will be
fast enough.

Yes if we ignore forced module unload (which needs to synchronously check
lo->lo_encryption) of cryptoloop module.

If we don't ignore forced module unload, we could update my patch to keep only
mutex_destroy() and kfree() deferred by a refcount, for only lo->lo_state,
lo->lo_refcnt and lo->lo_encryption would be accessed under lo->lo_mutex
serialization. There is no need to defer "del_gendisk() + idr_remove()"
sequence for concurrent callers.
