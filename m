Please do.

I don't doubt it worked well in his setup, and it'll probably be fine in
a lot of setups. But the point still stands - it's a magic value, it
should at least be documented. And 64 is likely way too much on a lot of
machines.

Right, this is why I suggested doing it like that. It's not very smart
to split related members like that, wastes both memory and is less
efficient than doing the right thing.

That's nonsense. That's like saying "to see what this series does, apply
the whole thing and compare it with the file before". With that logic,
why even split changes ever.

A big patch that could be split is harder to properly review than a lot
of small patches. Nobody ever reviews a 1000+ line patch. But I guess we
can just stop reviewing?

It should be split, it's really not up for debate.
