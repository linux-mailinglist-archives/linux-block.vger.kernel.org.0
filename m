I thought what Christoph meant (and of course, please let us know
if I'm misunderstanding you, Christoph) was that if blk-mq
handled all the blk-crypto stuff including deciding whether to
use the blk-crypto-fallback, and blk-mq was responsible for
calling out to blk-crypto-fallback if required, then the device
mapper wouldn't need to expose any capabilities at all... or at
least not for bio-based device mapper devices, since bios would
go through the device mapper and eventually hit blk-mq which
would then handle crypto appropriately.

We couldn't do that because the crypto ciphers for the
blk-crypto-fallback couldn't be allocated on the data path (so we
needed fscrypt to ask blk-crypto to check whether the underlying
device supported the crypto capabilities it required, and
allocate ciphers appropriately, before the data path required the
ciphers). I'm checking to see if anything has changed w.r.t
allocating crypto ciphers on the data path (and checking if
memalloc_noio_save/restore() helps with that).
