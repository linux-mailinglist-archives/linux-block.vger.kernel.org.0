Hi Jan,
I'm glad you're addressing these BFQ issues.  Sorry for the delay, but
I happen to be working on similar issues, for other sort of
corner-case workloads.  So I wanted to consolidate my changes before
replying.

Probably, the best first step for me, to check your proposal, is to
merge it with my current changes, and test the outcome.  In this
respect, my problem is that, after our last improvements for dbench,
we cannot reproduce regressions any longer.  So, we would need your
support to test both issues, i.e., to test throughput with dbench (on
your side/machines), and possible other regressions of your and my
changes (on our side/machines).

Would it be ok for you to participate in this little collaboration?
If it is, then I'll contact you privately to kick this off.

Thanks,
Paolo
