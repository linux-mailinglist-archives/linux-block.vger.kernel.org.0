This is the way it works for other blockdevs:

	echo 1 > /sys/class/block/sdX/device/rescan

... but of course bcache doesn't have a "device" folder.  Maybe a sysfs 
flag named "rescan" or "resize" would be appropriate:

Is it even possible to hot-resize a partition that is in use?  I usually 
get an error if a filesystem from sdb is mounted (or, presumably, if a 
partition is in use as a backing device by bcache):

	# blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sdb
	blockdev: ioctl error on BLKRRPART: Device or resource busy

(I've always wanted a feature in Linux's partition code to support
hot-grow for non-overlapping partition changes that keep the original
starting sector, like when you grow the last partition, but I
digress...)

+1, I'm one of those administrators...

In some cases the "manual command" to which you refer may take weeks:

Lets say you have a big hardware RAID5 and add a disk.  After the resize 
completes the RAID controller reports a new disk size to the OS:

	kernel: sd 2:0:0:1: [sdb] 503296888 512-byte logical blocks: (257 GB/239 GiB)
	kernel: sdb: detected capacity change from 150317101056 to 257688006656

Are you suggesting that if `sdb` is the backing device to `bcache0` that 
`bcache0` should be resized immediately when `sdb` detects a capacity 
change?

I would recommend against it:  while I can't control when the RAID
reconstruction finishes (since it takes 2 weeks for us to grow our
arrays), I would like to control when `bcache0` grows in case there is a
bug that triggers an IO hang (or worse).  At least then we can grow
`bcache0` in a maintenance window in case there is a "surprise".

IMHO, this should be controlable by the admin and should be a _manual_ 
procedure (ie, echo 1 > resize)

I've never seen a block dev resize call userspace commands from the kernel 
(like xfs_growfs or resize2fs).  Does that exist?  Again, to avoid
surprises, IMHO this should be a udev thing if someone wants it.

Yes, that is expected and desired:

Because a VM presents itself as hardware.  When you `virsh blockresize` 
from _outside_ of the VM, then the result is effectively the same as a 
RAID reconstruction completing and notifying the OS as in my example 
above.

However, bcache _should_ call `set_capacity_and_notify` when
  echo 1 > /sys/fs/bcache0/bcache/resize
happens, but I'm not convinced that it is a good idea to auto-resize 
`bcache0` when the backing device `sdb` grows.

I like the idea of supporting it as a feature for those who might want it, 
but please default it off for the sanity of admins who like more control.  

Maybe /sys/fs/bcache0/bcache/resize can be tri-state sysfs attribute:

	echo 0 > /sys/fs/bcache0/bcache/resize # default
	echo 1 > /sys/fs/bcache0/bcache/resize # one-shot, resets to 0
	echo 2 > /sys/fs/bcache0/bcache/resize # auto-resize on bdev change
