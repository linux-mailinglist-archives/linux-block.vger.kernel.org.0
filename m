In production phones, we have extended the migration type for mTHP
separately during Linux
boot[1].

[1] https://github.com/OnePlusOSS/android_kernel_oneplus_sm8650/blob/oneplu=
s/sm8650_u_14.0.0_oneplus12/mm/page_alloc.c#L2089

These pageblocks have their own migration type, resulting in a separate bud=
dy
free list.

We prevent order-0 allocations from drawing memory from this pool, ensuring=
 a
relatively high success rate for mTHP allocations.

In one instance, phones reported an mTHP allocation success rate of less th=
an 5%
after running for a few hours without this kind of reservation
mechanism. Therefore,
we need an upstream solution in the kernel to ensure sustainable mTHP suppo=
rt
across all scenarios.

TAO supports mTHP as long as it can be configured through the bootcmd:
nomerge=3D25%,4
This means we are providing a 4-order mTHP pool with 25% of total memory
reserved.

Note that the Android common kernel has already integrated TAO[2][3],
so we are trying
to use TAO to replace our previous approach of extending the migration type=
.

Correct. It's running on the phones[4][5], but I still don't know how
to handle it upstream
properly.

I=E2=80=99d say large granularity compression isn=E2=80=99t a problem, but =
large
granularity decompression
could be.

The worst case would be if we swap out a large block, such as 16KB,
but end up swapping in
4 times due to allocation failures, falling back to smaller folios. In
this scenario, we would need
to perform three redundant decompressions. I will work with Tangquan
to provide this data this
week.

But once we swap in small folios, they remain small (we can't collapse
them for mTHP).
As a result, the next time, they will be swapped out and swapped in as
small folios.
Therefore, this potential loss is one-time.
