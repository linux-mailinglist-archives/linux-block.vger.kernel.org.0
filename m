Hi Jianchao,

That's an interesting question. I'm in favor of flexibility. However,
I'm not sure whether it would be possible to combine an rq-qos policy
that submits high priority requests first with an I/O scheduler that
ignores I/O priorities. Since a typical I/O scheduler reorders requests,
such a combination would lead to requests being submitted in the wrong
order to storage devices. In other words, when using an I/O scheduler,
proper support for I/O priority in the I/O scheduler is essential. The
BFQ I/O scheduler is still maturing. The purpose of the Kyber I/O
scheduler is to control latency by reducing the queue depth without
differentiating between requests of the same type. The mq-deadline
scheduler is already being used in combination with storage devices that
support I/O priorities in their controller. Hence the choice for the
mq-deadline scheduler.

Thanks,

Bart.
