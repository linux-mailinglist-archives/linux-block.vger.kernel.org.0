BFQ and I/O schedulers aren't just simple "drivers'', but common
pieces of the storage stack.

As pointed out by Linus in his other reply, instead this strives
towards getting a sensible default configuration of the kernel.

Alright, so it sounds like it's rather a matter of the code's
complexity, whether it deserves to be default y or not. No?

I would rather let all the three I/O schedulers be default y, as it
looks like that would be the best default configuration of the kernel.
But it looks like we don't agree on that.
