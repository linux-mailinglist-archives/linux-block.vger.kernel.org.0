Hi Mike,

Actually I have one local v5.17 rebase:

https://github.com/ming1/linux/tree/my_v5.17-dm-io-poll

Also one for-5.18/block rebase which is done just now:

https://github.com/ming1/linux/tree/my_v5.18-dm-bio-poll

In my previous test on v5.17 rebase, the IOPS improvement is a bit small,
so I didn't post it out. Recently not get time to investigate
the performance further, so please feel free to work on it.


Thanks,
Ming
