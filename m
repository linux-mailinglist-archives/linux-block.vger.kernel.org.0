Arg, indeed, it is a mess. We need to fix this manpage too.

5a9d041ba2f6 was from Jens, but agreed, io priority initialization never has
been correct.

I agree that the task's CPU priority is a more sensible default. However, I do
not understand your point about the IO context being too early to set the
effective priority. If we do not do that, getting the issuer CPU priority will
not be easily possible, right ?

Yes, only IOPRIO_CLASS_RT has an effect at the hardware level right now.
Everything else is only for the IO scheduler to play with. I am preparing a
patch series to support scsi/ata command duration limits though. That adds a new
IOPRIO_CLASS_DL and that one will also have an effect on the hardware.

Note that if a process/thread use ioprio_set(), we should also honor the ioprio
set for buffered reads, at least those page IOs that are issued directly from
the IO issuer context (which may include readahead... hmmm).

Indeed it is.

I am OK with the use of the task CPU priority/ionice value as the default when
no other ioprio is set for a bio using the user aio_reqprio or ioprio_set(). If
this relies on task_nice_ioclass() as it is today (I see no reason to change
that), then the default class for regular tasks remains IOPRIO_CLASS_BE as is
defined by IOPRIO_DEFAULT.

But to avoid the performance regression you observed, we really need to be 100%
sure that all bios have their ->bi_ioprio field correctly initialized. Something
like:

void bio_set_effective_ioprio(struct *bio)
{
	switch (IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(bio->bi_ioprio)) {
	case IOPRIO_CLASS_RT:
	case IOPRIO_CLASS_BE:
	case IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE:
		/*
		 * the bio ioprio was already set from an aio kiocb ioprio
		 * (aio->aio_reqprio) or from the issuer context ioprio if that
		 * context used ioprio_set().
		 */;
		return;
	case IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE:
	default:
		/* Use the current task CPU priority */
		bio->ioprio =
			IOPRIO_PRIO_VALUE(task_nice_ioclass(current),
					  task_nice_ioprio(current));
		return;
	}
}

being called before a bio is inserted in a scheduler or bypass inserted in the
dispatch queues should result in all BIOs having an ioprio that is set to
something other than IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE. And the obvious place may be simply at
the beginning of submit_bio(), before submit_bio_noacct() is called.

I am tempted to argue that block device drivers should never see any req with an
ioprio set to IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE, which means that no bio should ever enter the
block stack with that ioprio either. With the above solution, bios from DM
targets submitted with submit_bio_noacct() could still have IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE...
So would submit_bio_noacct() be the better place to call the effective ioprio
helper ?
