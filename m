blk_mq_alloc_request_hctx() won't be called into qla2xxx queue, what we
need is to mark the nvmef queue as .use_managed_irq if the LLD uses
managed irq.

It is simply that blk_mq_alloc_request_hctx() allocates request from one
specified hctx, and the specified hctx can be offline any time.

It is totally a raw idea, something like: start each queue in poll mode,
and run connect IO queue command via polling. Once the connect io queue command
is done, switch the queue into normal mode. Then
blk_mq_alloc_request_hctx() is guaranteed to be successful.

I am fine to work this way first if no one objects.
