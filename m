I also agree that locking should be used at last.  But, as each driver manages
its devices and resources in their way, it could have its unique race
conditions.  And, each unique race condition might have its unique efficient
way to synchronize it.  Therefore, I think the synchronization should be done
by each driver, not by xenbus and thus we should make the callback to be called
per-driver.
