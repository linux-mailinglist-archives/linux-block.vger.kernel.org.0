Hi all,

What's the latest progress of this bio-based polling feature?

I've noticed that hch has also sent a patch set on this [1]. But as far
as I know, hch's patch set only refactors the interface of polling in
the block layer. It indeed helps bio-based polling for some kind of
bio-based driver, but for DM/MD where one bio could be mapped to several
split bios, more work is obviously needed, just like Lei Ming's
io_context related code in this patch set.

hch may have better idea, after all [1] is just a preparation patch set.
