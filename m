So in the crashdump I have available, I can see that 
_bio_blkcg(bio)->css.serial_nr is 4. Also bic->blkcg_serial_nr is 4. But
bic->bfqq[1] is a bfq_queue that has its entity->parent set to already
offlined bfq_group. Not sure how that is possible...

I agree shared queues are some factor in this - the problematic bfq_queue
pointing to the dead bfq_group has 'coop' flag set, pid == -1, bic ==
NULL. So clearly it has been merged with another bfq_queue.

There's no next_bfqq in the kernel I'm looking into... Generally the merge
code seems to be working somewhat differently to what you describe (I'm
looking into 5.16-rc3 kernel).

Honestly, I'm not sure. At this point I'm not sure why the bfqq pointed to
from bic didn't get reparented to the new cgroup when bio was submitted...
