Sure, I'm just hacking now to see what difference it can make to 
performance. Early results look promising...

BTW, one more thing which Kashyap and I looked at when initially 
developing the hostwide tag support was the wait struct usage in tag 
exhaustion scenario:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/ecaeccf029c6fe377ebd4f30f04df9f1@mail.gmail.com/

IIRC, we looked at a "hostwide" wait_index - it didn't seem to make a 
difference then, and we didn't end up make any changes here, but still 
worth remembering.

Thanks,
John
