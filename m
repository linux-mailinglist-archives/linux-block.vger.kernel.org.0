Yes, looks blk-mq has to be notified before unplugging CPU for this
issue.

And we should be careful to handle the multiple reply queue case, given the queue
shouldn't be stopped or quieseced because other reply queues are still active.

The new CPUHP state for blk-mq should be invoked after the to-be-offline
CPU is quiesced and before it becomes offline.
