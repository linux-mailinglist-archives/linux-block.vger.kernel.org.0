Apologies for the late submission - this was unintentional. The core changes
were ready before 6.15, but the final llbitmap patch got delayed due to 
review
backlog.

About the last patch:
  - all feedback are addressed 2 weeks ago
  - still waiting formal Reviewed-by tag, not sure why, possibly due to 
this patch
     is huge.

About the rebase, this is because llbitmap set has conflicts with other 
patches
during the period, and I sent a new version and just pick it last night.

I do take a bet sending this pr last night, and hoping llbitmap won't 
delayed to
next merge window again.  However, I fully understand if this misses 6.17,
I'm prepared to defer to 6.18.

Thanks,
Kuai
