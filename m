This issue is a nightmare :)

Userspace wants the weight to be called weight (I'm not reporting
links to threads again).  *Any* solution that gets to this is ok for me.

A solution that both fulfills userspace request and doesn't break
anything for hypothetical users of the current interface already made
it to mainline, and Linus liked it too.  It is:
19e9da9e86c4 ("block, bfq: add weight symlink to the bfq.weight cgroup =
parameter")

But it was then reverted on Tejun's request to do exactly what we
don't want do any longer now:
cf8929885de3 ("cgroup/bfq: revert bfq.weight symlink change")

So, Jens, Tejun, can we please just revert that revert?

Thanks,
Paolo
