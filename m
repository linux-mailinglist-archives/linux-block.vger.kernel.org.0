I hope we can make that option a last resort.

It looks straight forward to relocate the attribute to the the
queue_limits. If it stacks correctly, then no one would encounter a
problem no matter what md/dm combination you have.

I have something that looks promising, but I'm trying to give it a
thorough test before sending out another incomplete patch. Hopefully
ready by end of the day.
