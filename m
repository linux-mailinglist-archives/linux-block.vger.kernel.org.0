Hi Ming,

Thanks for the patch!  But I'm having a hard time understanding what
you've written in the patch header,

It'd be helpful if you could unpack this with more detail before going on
to explain why using blk_queue_quiesced, despite dm-rq using
blk_mq_queue_stopped, would also be ineffective.

SO:

> dm-rq won't stop queue

1) why won't dm-rq stop the queue?  Do you mean it won't reliably
   _always_ stop the queue because of the blk_mq_queue_stopped() check?

> meantime blk-mq won't stop one queue too, so remove the check.

2) Meaning?: blk_mq_queue_stopped() will return true even if only one hw
queue is stopped, given blk-mq must stop all hw queues a positive return
from this blk_mq_queue_stopped() check is incorrectly assuming it meanss
all hw queues are stopped.

But I'm left with questions/confusion on this too:

1) you mention blk_queue_quiesced instead of blk_mq_queue_stopped, so I
   assume you mean that: not only is blk_mq_queue_stopped()
   ineffective, blk_queue_quiesced() would be too?

2) the race you detail (with competing blk_mq_quiesce_queue) relative to
   synchronize_rcu() and testing "the flag" is very detailed yet vague.

Anyway, once we get this heaader cleaned up a bit more I'll be happy to
get this staged as a stable@ fix for 5.8 inclusion ASAP.

Thanks!
Mike
