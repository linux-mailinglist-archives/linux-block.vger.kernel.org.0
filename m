Could you explain it a bit about the fundamental issues for all types of
host?

It is just for hosts with multiple reply queues, such as hisi_sas v3,
megaraid_sas, mpt3sas and hpsa.

The performance regression shouldn't have been introduced in theory, and it is
because blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() iterates over the same duplicated tags multiple
times, which can be fixed easily.

1) convert reply queue into blk-mq hw queue first

2) then all drivers are in same position wrt. handling requests vs.
unplugging CPU (shutdown managed IRQ)

The current handling in blk_mq_hctx_notify_dead() is actually wrong,
at that time, all CPUs on the hctx are dead, blk_mq_run_hw_queue()
still dispatches requests on driver's hw queue, and driver is invisible
to DEAD CPUs mapped to this hctx, and finally interrupt for these
requests on the hctx are lost.

Frankly speaking, the above 2nd problem is still hard to solve.

1) take_cpu_down() shutdown managed IRQ first, then run teardown callback
for states in [CPUHP_AP_ONLINE, CPUHP_AP_OFFLINE) on the to-be-offline
CPU

2) However, all runnable tasks are removed from the CPU in the teardown
callback for CPUHP_AP_SCHED_STARTING, which is run after managed IRQs
are shutdown. That said it is hard to avoid new request queued to
the hctx with all DEAD CPUs.

3) we don't support to freeze queue for specific hctx yet, or that way
may not be accepted because of extra cost in fast path

4) once request is allocated, it should be submitted to driver no matter
if CPU hotplug happens or not. Or free it and re-allocate new request
on proper sw/hw queue?

I plan to make this patchset workable on 5.2-rc for your test first.
