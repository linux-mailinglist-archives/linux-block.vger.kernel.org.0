bcache.rst is from the original bcache.txt which was merged in mainline
kernel v3.10. There are a few things changed in the past 7 years. This
patch updates bache.rst documents in following content,
- Update bcache-tools git repo to,
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/colyli/bcache-tools.git/
- Update bcache kernel tree to mainline kernel tree,
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/
- make-bcache util is replaced by the unified bcache util,
  `make-bcache` now can be performed by `bcache make`
