I'd rather not add it because if we finish to clean up the internal API,
then we can have fd_outb(value, base, reg) and fd_inb(base, reg) where
reg is one of FD_* and base the base address. In this context we don't
need the mask anymore since the register is placed there verbatim.

I do have another earlier patch which did just that, its just that I
attacked the problem from the wrong side, resulting in too many changes
at once for my taste. But I definitely see how we can finish that job
and make everything almost elegant.
