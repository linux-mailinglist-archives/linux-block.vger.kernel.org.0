Hi Keith, Christoph:

Adriano who started this thread (cc'ed) reported that setting 
queue/write_cache to "write back" provides much higher latency on his NVMe 
than "write through"; I tested a system here and found the same thing.

Here is Adriano's summary:

        # cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/write_cache
        write through
        # ioping -c10 /dev/nvme0n1 -D -Y -WWW -s4K
        ...
        min/avg/max/mdev = 60.0 us / 78.7 us / 91.2 us / 8.20 us
                                     ^^^^ ^^

        # for i in /sys/block/*/queue/write_cache; do echo 'write back' > $i; done
        # ioping -c10 /dev/nvme0n1 -D -Y -WWW -s4K
        ...
        min/avg/max/mdev = 1.81 ms / 1.89 ms / 2.01 ms / 82.3 us
                                     ^^^^ ^^

Interestingly, Adriano's is 24.01x and ours is 23.97x higher latency
higher (see below).  These 24x numbers seem too similar to be a
coincidence on such different configurations.  He's running Linux 5.4
and we are on 4.19.

Is this expected?


More info:

The stack where I verified the behavior Adriano reported is slightly
different, NVMe's are under md RAID1 with LVM on top, so latency is
higher, but still basically the same high latency difference with
writeback enabled:

	]# cat /sys/block/nvme[01]n1/queue/write_cache
	write through
	write through
	]# ionice -c1 -n1 ioping -c10 /dev/ssd/ssd-test -D -s4k -WWW -Y
	...
	min/avg/max/mdev = 119.1 us / 754.9 us / 2.67 ms / 1.02 ms


	]# cat /sys/block/nvme[01]n1/queue/write_cache
	write back
	write back
	]# ionice -c1 -n1 ioping -c10 /dev/ssd/ssd-test -D -s4k -WWW -Y
	...
	min/avg/max/mdev = 113.4 us / 18.1 ms / 29.2 ms / 9.53 ms
