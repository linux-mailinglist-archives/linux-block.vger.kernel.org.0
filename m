yes.

Yep. But even that one is actually coded in scsi to return a -EIO instead of
ENOTSUPP. We can patch that (return ENOTSUPP for an invalid opcode error), but I
am not sure if that is safe to do given that this has been like this for ages.

This is all to say that we cannot even reliably distinguish special/valid error
cases that can be recovered from actual medium/hard errors.

I have test cases for zonefs already. That is because zonefs has the
"recover-error" mount option which forces a recovery of a file size (== write
pointer position) if a write fails or is torn. The default even for zonefs is to
go read-only since there is indeed not much we can do about failed writes.

OK. Will try to improve it.

Hmmm... not sure we have a good place for this. Let me figure out something.
