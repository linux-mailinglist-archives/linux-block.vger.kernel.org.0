Agree, and there could be more things involved:

1) pt request shares same tags, so scheduler tags is used for allocating pt
request

2) RQF_ELV is set for pt request, and e->type->ops.requeue_request()/
e->type->ops.completed_request() still might be called for pt request.

Probably long-term one dedicated request queue(BLK_MQ_F_TAG_QUEUE_SHARED/
BLK_MQ_F_NO_SCHED) could be used for handling passthrough only if the device
exposes pt interface. Then I guess core code may be cleaned a bit and
becomes easier to improve both two paths, but plug handling still have
to cover both.
