Hi Jan, Khazhy,
sorry for my super delay.  Thanks Khazy for spotting this, and Jan for
proposing alternative solutions.

Trying to put pieces together:
1) Moving ahead the invocation of spin_unlock_irq(&bfqd->lock) in
bfq_bio_merge(), as suggested by Jan, seems ok to me as well.  I also
proposed this change several years ago, but received no feedback.  So
I followed the conservative approach of not touching what apparently
works :)
2) If I'm not missing anything, then also what Jan suggests below is
ok.  That is, in blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge, ioc->lock gets grabbed
only in case blk_mq_free_request is invoked.  So it is ok to simply move
the invocation of blk_mq_free_request outside
blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge, using the same approach as with
blk_mq_sched_try_merge in bfq_bio_merge.

Thanks,
Paolo
