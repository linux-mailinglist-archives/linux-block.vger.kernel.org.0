Hi Damien,

Adding a use_zone_write_lock argument to disk_set_zoned() seems wrong to 
me. The information about whether or not to use the zone write lock 
comes from the LLD. The zone model is retrieved by the ULD. Since both 
pieces of information come from different drivers, both properties 
should be modified independently.

Moving the use_zone_write_lock member variable into a data structure 
owned by the ULD seems wrong to me because that member variable is set 
by the LLD.

Reviewers are allowed to request changes for well-designed and working 
code but should be able to explain why they request these changes. Can 
you please explain why you care about the value of 
q->limits.use_zone_write_lock for the BLK_ZONED_NONE case? If 
dd_use_zone_write_locking() would be renamed and would be moved into 
include/linux/blkdev.h and if reads of q->limits.use_zone_write_lock 
would be changed into blk_use_zone_write_locking() calls then the value 
of q->limits.use_zone_write_lock for the BLK_ZONED_NONE case wouldn't 
matter at all.

Thanks,

Bart.
