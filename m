Hi Bart,

Thanks for pointing this out.
Yes, the purpose of my patch is exactly same as Ming's patch you referred
to, albeit it achieves the same purpose in a different way.

If the earlier patch makes it upstream, then my patch is not needed.

Thanks,
Sumanesh

Hi Sumanesh,

Can you have a look at the following patch series and see whether it has
perhaps the same purpose as your patch?

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-scsi/20191118103117.978-1-ming.lei@redhat.com/

Thanks,

Bart.
