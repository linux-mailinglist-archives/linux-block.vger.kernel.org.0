The original polling implementation shared resources that generate
interrupts. This prevents it from running as fast as it can, so
dedicated polling queues are used now.

> How come we cannot have a device/controller level setup of polled io today in 5.x kernels, all that exists is module based?

Polled queues are a dedicated resource that we have to reserve up front.
They're optional, so you don't need to use the hipri flag if you have a
device you don't want polled. But we need to know how many queues to
reserve before we've even discovered the controllers, so we don't have a
good way to define it per-controller.
