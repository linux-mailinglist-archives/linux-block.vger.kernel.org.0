I don't think this works, especially if the COW mechanism relies on
delayed allocation to prevent ENOSPC during writeback. That is, we
need a write() or page fault (to run ->page_mkwrite()) after every
call to folio_clear_dirty_for_io() in the writeback path to ensure
that new space is reserved for the allocation that will occur
during a future writeback of that page.

Hence we can't just leave the page dirty on COW filesystems - it has
to go through a clean state so that the clean->dirty event can be
gated on gaining the space reservation that allows it to be written
back again.

Cheers,

Dave.
