Oh, right, I forgot that plug list stores already requests, not bios.

Yes, fair point. I was thinking only about a few requests but it the request
sequence is like 0 2 4 6 ... 2n 1 3 5 7 ... 2n+1, then bio merging will
result in 'n' requests while request merging will be able to get it down to
1 request.

I'll keep the recursive merge and pass back list of requests to free
instead. Thanks for explanations!
