Can you explain this in more detail? It seems like an iSCSI or
NVMe-over-TCP initiator could be implemented as a ublk server today.
What am I missing?

I think this could already be implemented today. There will be extra
memory copies because SPDK won't have access to the application's memory
pages.

Linux VFIO provides a safe userspace API for userspace device drivers.
That means memory and interrupts are isolated. Neither userspace nor the
hardware device can access memory or interrupts that the userspace
process is not allowed to access.

I think there are still limitations like all memory pages exposed to the
device need to be pinned. So effectively you might still need privileges
to get the mlock resource limits.

But overall I think what you're saying about root and unprivileged ublk
devices is not true. Hardware support should be developed with the goal
of supporting unprivileged userspace ublk servers.

Those unprivileged userspace ublk servers cannot claim any PCI device
they want. The user/admin will need to give them permission to open a
network card, SCSI HBA, etc.

DMA with an IOMMU requires an I/O Virtual Address, not a CPU physical
address. The IOVA space is defined by the IOMMU page tables. Userspace
controls the IOMMU page tables via Linux VFIO ioctls.

For example, <linux/vfio.h> struct vfio_iommu_type1_dma_map defines the
IOMMU mapping that makes a range of userspace virtual addresses
available at a given IOVA.

Mapping and unmapping operations are not free. Similar to mmap(2), the
program will be slow if it does this frequently.

I think it's effectively the same problem as ublk zero-copy. We want to
give the ublk server access to just the I/O buffers that it currently
needs, but doing so would be expensive :(.

I think Linux has strategies for avoiding the expense like
iommu.strict=3D0 and swiotlb. The drawback is that in our case userspace
and/or the hardware device controller by userspace would still have
access to the memory pages after I/O has completed. This reduces memory
isolation :(.

DPDK/SPDK and QEMU use long-lived Linux VFIO DMA mappings.

What I'm trying to get at is that either memory isolation is compromised
or performance is reduced. It's hard to have good performance together
with memory isolation.

I think ublk should follow the VFIO philosophy of being a safe
kernel/userspace interface. If userspace is malicious or buggy, the
kernel's and other process' memory should not be corrupted.

I think this is possible today. The ublk server owns the I/O buffers. It
can mlock them and DMA map them via VFIO. ublk doesn't need to know
anything about this.

> - this way is still zero copy

True zero-copy would be when an application does O_DIRECT I/O and the
hardware device DMAs to/from the application's memory pages. ublk
doesn't do that today and when combined with VFIO it doesn't get any
easier. I don't think it's possible because you cannot allow userspace
to control a hardware device and grant DMA access to pages that
userspace isn't allowed to access. A malicious userspace will program
the device to access those pages :).

I wonder how much difference there is between the new io_uring command
for receiving VFIO irqs that you are suggesting compared to the existing
io_uring approach IORING_OP_READ eventfd.

Stefano Garzarella and I have discussed but not yet attempted to add a
userspace memory polling command to io_uring. IORING_OP_POLL_MEMORY
would be useful together with IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL. That way kernel
polling can be combined with userspace polling on a single CPU.

I'm not sure it's useful for ublk because you may not have any reason to
use IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL. But applications that have an Linux NVMe block
device open with IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL could use the new
IORING_OP_POLL_MEMORY command to also watch for activity on a VIRTIO or
VFIO PCI device or maybe just to get kicked by another userspace thread.
