I'm sure that would work, but I think that's missing the point. It's not
that the setup isn't capable of merging at all. It just can't deal with
segments that are too large.

While I was debugging this, I was frequently seeing cases where the SG
was on the order of 40 entries initially and after dma_map_sg() it was
reduced to just 4 or 5.

So I think merging is still really useful if a setup supports it via an
IOMMU. I'm just not sure I see why we can't make the code respect what-
ever the maximum segment size that the driver may have configured. That
seems like it should allow us to get the best of both worlds.
