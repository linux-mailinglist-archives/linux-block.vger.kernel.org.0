I'm not trying to work around it. The purpose of this is to solve
the problem of nvme native multipathing at the same time.

Of course, it is also an idea to repair the block drivers directly.
However, block layer is unaware of nvme native multipathing, will cause
the request return error which should be avoided.
The scenario: use two HBAs for nvme native multipath, and then one HBA
fault, the blk_status_t of queue_rq is BLK_STS_IOERR, blk-mq will call
blk_mq_end_request to complete the request which bypass name native
multipath. We expect the request fail over to normal HBA, but the request
is directly completed with BLK_STS_IOERR.
The two scenarios can be fixed by directly completing the request in queue_rq.
