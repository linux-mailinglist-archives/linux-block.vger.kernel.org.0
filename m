CPU load is more than 32MB bio size. Because bio_sumbit progress is doing in parallel.
But I tested it same CPU operation frequency, So there are no difference of CPU speed.
Logically, bio max size is 4GB now. it's not realistic I know, but 4GB merge to a bio
will takes much time even if CPU works fast.
This is why I think bio max size should be limited.

OK, I agree with you. It will be best for all now.
I'll try to make this.
