Yeah, that is the reason why this patch makes pt request batch and
bypass them all, so nvme uring cmd pt io perf won't be hurt.

So I guess now you are fine with this patch? If that is true, I will post V2
with revised comment log, such as, including Christoph's related comment.

Otherwise, any suggestion wrt. early bypass?

- bypass in case of scheduler, but still a bit tricky, why does pt need
  to care elevator? Meantime performance is still affected for any IOs
  sharing the current plug
