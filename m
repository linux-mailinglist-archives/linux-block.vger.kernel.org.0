Hello my dear,

Could you help me to receive an inheritance fund at the rate of
$4,900,000.00USD (Four Million Nine hundred thousand US Dollars)?

Into your bank account in your country or elsewhere.

A fund has been overdue for International transfer in one of the account
held in our Banque Commerciale du Burkina BCB. In our research we found out
that the original owner of this fund died in a fatal gassy car-accident
that killed both him and his only son whom was supposed to be a beneficiary
next of kin to his father=E2=80=99s asset. This accident happened on his wa=
y back
to one of his factory in suburb Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

The owner of this fund is a citizen of South Korea, he own about 2
companies here in Burkina Faso 1 textile meal Plant, and another cement
manufacturing factory, all of this generated him a lot of money here in
Africa.

In the light of the above, I am reaching you with this notification to
revert back to me so we can discuss on the successful manners to remits
this fund into your bank account in your country.

This fund is overdue for transfer or withdrawal to be made, but nobody has
been coming for this fund hence the owner of fund is dead and the supposed
beneficiary Next of Kin which is his only son dead too. No information
pertaining the deposit of this fund has passed to anybody or organization.
And my position in the bank cannot allow me to lay claim on this fund
because the owner is a foreigner and we the citizen of Burkina Faso are not
permitted to interfere in any foreign affairs.

If you are interested to receive this fund under my guidelines I am able to
give you all information=E2=80=99s and the password to pass through our ban=
k
examination for approval to transfer fund to your bank.

Just reply me and give me your full names and telephone
number=E2=80=99s=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=

=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6

We shall talk about the percentage sharing of fund between both of us, in
return e-mail, more details and information shall be released to you
immediately you indicate your interest.

Reply me at: kamaraalima287@gmail.com. or call me at +226 65227686

Waiting very urgent to discuss with you.
