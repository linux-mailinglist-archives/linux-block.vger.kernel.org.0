Okay, you want to use it much finer-grained to understand individual
end-to-end latencies for your services, rather than "the system is
melting down and I want to know why." That sounds valid to me.

I'm a bit concerned about the maintainability of these things. It
makes moving code around harder, and it forces somebody who has no
interest in this debugging facility to thing about the categories.

And naming them is hard even for somebody who does care. I'm not a fan
of MEMSTALL_MEMDELAY, for example because it's way too
non-descript. The distinction between MEMSTALL_WORKINGSET_REFAULT and
MEMSTALL_WORKINGSET_THRASH is dubious as well.

These are recipes for bit rot and making the code harder to hack on.

I see two options to do this better: One is to use stack traces as
identifiers instead of a made-up type. The other is to use the calling
function as the id (see how kmalloc_track_caller() utilizes _RET_IP_).

bpftrace can use the stack as a map key. So this should already work
without any kernel modifications, using @start[tid, kstack]?
