If you are fine to fail PT request, I'd suggest to handle the
problem in the following way:

1) moving freeze into reset

2) during resetting

- freeze NS queues
- unquiesce NS queues
- nvme_wait_freeze()
- update_nr_hw_queues
- unfreeze NS queues

3) meantime changes driver's ->queue_rq() in case that ctrl state is NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING,

- if the request is FS IO with data, re-submit all bios of this request,
  and free the request

- otherwise, fail the request  

With this way, not only freeze is paired with unfreeze. More
importantly, it becomes not possible to trigger new timeout during
handling NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING, then fallback to ctrl removal can
be avoided.

Any comment on this approach?

Thanks,
Ming
