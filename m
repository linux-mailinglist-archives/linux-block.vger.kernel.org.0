It's carry-over from the early days when structures had so few constants
that giving each field values their own enum looked a bit silly, and
enums were considered better than a bunch of #define's.

As far as naming them goes, if the only usage is its definition, then
what's the point? If there's a use for a named enum somewhere else, then
yah, that improves readability.
