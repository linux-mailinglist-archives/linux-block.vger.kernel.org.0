Yikes, that is a pretty stupid standard.  Almost as bad as allowing
non-uniform sized non-power of two sized zones :)

It's also easy to imagine a workload scenario where parallel access to the same disk could be useful. (Think of a typical storage design that sequentially writes new user data gradually filling the disk, while simultaneously supporting random user reads over the written data.)

But for those drivers you do not actually need this scheme at all.
Storage devices that support higher concurrency are bog standard with
SSDs and if you want to go back storage arrays.  The only interesting
case is when these ranges are separate so that the access can be carved
up based on the boundary.  Now I don't want to give people ideas with
overlapping but not identical, which would be just horrible.
