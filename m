The first patch in my series solves the issues reported by community also:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/1614957294-188540-2-git-send-email-john.garry@huawei.com/

And that patch should give no throughput performance hit.

The other two patches in that series are to solve more theoretical 
issues of iterator interactions, but their approach is unacceptable.

Obviously your call. IMHO, Bart's solution would make more sense.

Thanks,
John
