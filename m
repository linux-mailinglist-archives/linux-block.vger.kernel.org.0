Yes, that needs fixing.. but not urgently so.

OK, I can just nuke those wrappers.  But yeah, none of this setup code
is fast path.

Right, I'm aware.. ugly but not a case that really matters (more below).

It can happen that someone loads a table without any targets but it
isn't a case that matters given IO cannot be sent anywhere.  For that
to happen the DM table will have been reloaded to have targets (at
which point all will be setup properly, assuming no bugs like was
fixed here).

I do see you've since pulled the changes.

Thanks,
Mike
