It's not a matter of which is better, its a matter of making the code
more robust because it has a single code-path. If moving to percpu_ref
is negligible, I would suggest to move both, I don't want to have two
completely different mechanism for blocking vs. non-blocking.

Not sure what you mean, the percpu_ref is taken exactly where rcu is
taken, not sure what is the difference.
