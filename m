As far as I can tell, there are two options.

1. Objectively smallest option is to just disable -Walign-mismatch for
   the whole translation unit. The benefit of this route is one small
   and simple patch. The downside is that if there are any more
   instances of this added in the future, they won't be caught. May or
   may not actually happen or be a big deal.

 obj-$(CONFIG_BLK_SCSI_REQUEST)	+= scsi_ioctl.o

2. Use the __diag() infrastructure, which would allow us to locally
   disable the warning while adding a comment. The benefit of this
   approach is that the warning is only disabled for the problematic
   line so other instances can be caught. The downside is there is a
   little churn as it will involve a patch for the initial __diag()
   support for clang (as it has not needed it yet) and a few more lines
   in block/blk-mq.c. Additionally, the reason for the warning can be
   documented (the comment can obviously be improved).

I would say the preference is ultimately up to the maintainer, unless my
fellow ClangBuiltLinux maintainers/contributors have any further
comments/objections.

Cheers,
Nathan
