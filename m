I guess you might misunderstand this patch which just enables lockdep for
freezing & entering queue, so that lockdep can be used for running early
verification on patches & kernel.

The basic idea is to model .q_usage_counter as rwsem:

- treat freeze_queue as down_write_trylock()
- treat enter_queue() as down_read()

We needn't to care relation with other locks if the following is true:

- .q_usage_counter can be aligned with lock, and

- the modeling in this patch is correct.

Then lock order can be verified by lockdep.

This is just one specific issue which can be reported with lockdep
support, but this patch only focus on how to model freeze/enter queue as lock,
so please move discussion on this specific lock issue to another standalone thread.

Can you explain a bit more? I think this patch doesn't provide
`additional` info to lockdep APIs.

So far it isn't possible, nvme subsystem freezes queue in one context,
and unfreezes queue from another context, this way has caused many
trouble.

And it needs to refactor nvme error handling code path for removing
SKIP_FREEZE_LOCKDEP, not short-term thing.

I think it isn't basically possible since lock won't be used in this way.
More importantly we have covered many enough cases already by not taking
blk_queue_exit() into account.


Thanks,
