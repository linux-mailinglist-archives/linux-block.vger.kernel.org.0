Not only this; it's downright dangerous attempting to do that in SCSI.
In SCSI we don't have fixed lifetime guarantees that NVMe has, so there 
will be a race condition between timeout and command completion.
Plus there is no interface in SCSI allowing to 'poll' for completions in 
a meaningful manner.

I would rather _not_ put more functionality into the virtio_scsi timeout 
handler; this only serves to assume that the timeout handler has some 
functionality in virtio.
Which it patently hasn't, as the prime reason for a timeout handler is 
to _abort_ a command, which we can't on virtio.
Well, we can on virtio, but qemu as the main user will re-route the I/O 
from virtio into doing async-I/O, and there is no way how we can abort 
outstanding asynchronous I/O.
Or any other ioctl, for that matter.
