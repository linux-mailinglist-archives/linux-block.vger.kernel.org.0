Hi Christoph,

The upstream activity is being planned and will take sometime to reach to
that state as we have to make it ready for latest kernel.

To achieve the same, we were finding some solutions to handle latest changes.
If you have scanned my previous email where I have provided a detail what the driver
is doing, I did mention that we plan to use "blk_mq_submit_bio" but failed to do
so, as code is not exported. So, to the specific answer, this API is NOT being
used anywhere as of now.

However, as you mentioned, the API cannot be exported for any specific driver,
is there any solution or way if a custom driver wants to hook the existing bio path
and massage it and then fall back to original flow ?

Regards,

~Praveen.
