Surely that RAID4/5/6 performs better when you write a full stripe. But 
I'd like to know whether individual SSDs have increased IOPS when the 
request size is increased.

The write tests that I did (some years ago, I don't remember the details) 
showed that SSDs have the best write IOPS for 4k requests. For smaller 
requests they perform worse (because of read-modify-write), for larger 
requests they also have slightly less IOPS (because they write more data 
per request).

If there is some particular SSD that has more write IOPS for 8k requests 
than for 4k requests, I'd like to know about it - out of curiosity.

When I was developing dm-integrity, I just aligned metadata and data on 4k 
boundary, regardless of what the underlying device advertised.

The patch that I made tries to round down optimal IO size to 4k, it 
doesn't force optimal IO size to be 4k.
