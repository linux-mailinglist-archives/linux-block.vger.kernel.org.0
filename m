No passive tense there. Or do you mean usage like: "Go to hell" or
"Fix memory leak in ..."? I studied French and Latin at school; at a
guess, my mother tongue got its grammar from the former. My mother
taught English grammar and the term "imperative wording" rings no
bells in my grammatical education. Google agrees with me.
Please define: "imperative wording".

In the workflow I'm used to, others (closer to LT) make that decision.
Why waste my time?

Twas testing a 6 GB allocation with said function on my 8 GB laptop.
It failed and free told me 5 GB had disappeared (and
'cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak' told me _nothing_). Umm, it is
potentially a HUGE f@#$ing memory LEAK! Best to call a spade a spade.
