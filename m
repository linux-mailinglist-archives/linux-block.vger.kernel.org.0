Excuse me? I couldn't tell you say "remove ... from ..." or "move ... from ... to ...".

The point of my patch is to avoid

  disk->open_mutex => lo->lo_mutex

  disk->open_mutex => loop_validate_mutex => lo->lo_mutex

dependency chain, for there is

  system_transition_mutex/1 => disk->open_mutex

dependency chain and

  blk_mq_freeze_queue()/blk_mq_unfreeze_queue()

are called with lo->lo_mutex held.

Christoph's "[PATCH 4/8] loop: don't freeze the queue in lo_release" and
"[PATCH 5/8] loop: only freeze the queue in __loop_clr_fd when needed" stops
calling blk_mq_freeze_queue()/blk_mq_unfreeze_queue() with lo->lo_mutex held
only from lo_release(). There are locations (e.g. __loop_update_dio()) which
calls blk_mq_freeze_queue()/blk_mq_unfreeze_queue() with lo->lo_mutex held.

Hmm, "these patches" === "yet another approach to fix the loop lock order inversions v3"
than my "[PATCH v2] loop: don't hold lo->lo_mutex from lo_open() and lo_release()" ?

Yes, please. I don't know about invalidation.
But can't we instead remove

	if (lo->lo_state != Lo_bound)
		return BLK_STS_IOERR;

 from loop_queue_rq() ? There is some mechanism which can guarantee that crash
does not happen even if lo_queue_work() is called (blk_mq_*freeze_queue() ?),
isn't there?

Userspace may open this loop device with arbitrary delay; this is asyncronous
notification. By the moment some userspace process opens this loop device and
issues a read request as a response to "this device is ready", loop_clr_fd()
can be called (because lo_open() no longer holds lo->lo_mutex) by some other
process and this loop device can become unbound. There must be some mechanism
which can guarantee that crash does not happen.

It looks weired, but I think it is unavoidable in order to keep kernel
locking dependency chain simple, for in-kernel openers might be holding
e.g. system_transition_mutex/1.

My patch behaves as if

  int fd = open("/dev/loopX", 3);
  ioctl(fd, LOOP_CLR_FD);
  close(fd);

is automatically called when close() by the last user of /dev/loopX returns,
in order to keep kernel locking dependency chain short and simple.
Nothing difficult.
