This is not finished yet. The final version should go into upstream as a
fix for current badblocks routines.

This is in-memory data structure management which is almost irrelevant
to md raid or other on-disk layout.

This is 100% separated from md raid, as well as current badblocks code,
it is just about combine or split some [start, length] extent in a
table. The purpose of this patch is to fixing some reported issue from
users and our customers.

For me the motivation is just people report bugs and I fix it. If there
is new code to replace it in upstream, then I just continue to maintain
the new code for our users and customers.

Currently blocks/badblocks.c is used by md raid and nvdimm code, and the
badblocks table is irrelevant to any of these two subsystems.

If there will be better code for similar or better functionality, it
should be cool. For me, if the reporting bug is fixed, no difference in
my view :-)

Thanks.
