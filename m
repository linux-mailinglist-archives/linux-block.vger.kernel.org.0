I really don't think thi should be a method, and I really do dislike
how we have all this "if (is_mq)" junk.  Why can't we have a flag on
the gendisk that signals if the device can support polling that
is autoamtically set for blk-mq and as-needed by bio based drivers?
And please move everything that significantly hanges things for the
mq based path to separate prep patches early in th series.
