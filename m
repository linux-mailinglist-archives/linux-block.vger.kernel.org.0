Doing (1) first will give you a regular nvme namespace block device that yo=
u can=0A=
use to send passthrough commands with ioctl(). So (1) gives you (2).=0A=
=0A=
However, I do not understand what io-uring has to do with passthrough. io-u=
ring=0A=
being a block layer functionality, I do not think you can use it to send=0A=
passthrough commands to the driver. I amy be wrong though, but my understan=
ding=0A=
is that for NVMe, passthrough is either ioctl() to device file or the entir=
e=0A=
driver in user space with SPDK.=0A=
=0A=
As for (3), I do not understand your point. If you have (1), then an FS=0A=
requiring zone append will work.=0A=
