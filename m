No, not sure how you got there. I'd have thought the 5 references to
"REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT" would've been sufficient ;)

This patch makes it so requests marked with REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT are
allowed to use NVMe's local retry (that is required for non-transport
errors).

What the patch header, code and code comment detail.
