It's not ideal, but not sure I see a better way to fix it. You see the
case on failure, which we could check for (don't write cookie if it's
invalid). But this won't fix the case where the IO complete fast, or
even immediately.

Hence I think you're right, there's really no way around doing the bio
ref counting, even for the sync case. Care to cook up a patch we can
take a look at? I can run some high performance sync testing too, so we
can see how badly it might hurt.

The polling really just ignores that, it doesn't take multi requests
into account. We just poll for the first part of it.
