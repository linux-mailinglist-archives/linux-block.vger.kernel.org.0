Yes, usually the app using ublk is supposed to be completely generic,
and won't be taken into account.

When ublk server is crashed, ublk_abort_requests() will be called to fail
queued inflight requests. Meantime ubq->canceling is set to requeue
new request instead of forwarding it to ublk server.

So behavior A should be supported easily by failing request in
ublk_queue_rq() if ubq->canceling is set.

UBLK_F_USER_RECOVERY is supposed for supporting to recover device, and
if this flag isn't enabled, we don't support the feature simply, so
looks behavior 2 isn't one valid case, is it?

Please see if the above reply can address this case.
