What you've done here is fairly chaotic/disruptive:
1) you emailed a patch out that isn't needed or ideal, I dealt already
   staged a DM fix in linux-next for 5.10-rcX, see:
   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-5.10-rcX&id=f28de262ddf09b635095bdeaf0e07ff507b3c41b
2) you replied to your patch and started referencing snippets of this
   other patch's header (now staged for 5.10-rcX via Jens' block tree):
   https://git.kernel.dk/cgit/linux-block/commit/?h=block-5.10&id=7e7986f9d3ba69a7375a41080a1f8c8012cb0923
   - why not reply to _that_ patch in response something stated in it?
3) you started telling me, and others on these lists, why you think I
   used lcm_not_zero().
   - reality is I wanted gcd() behavior, I just didn't reason through
     the math to know it.. it was a stupid oversight on my part.  Not
     designed with precision.
4) Why not check with me before you craft a patch like others reported
   the problem to you? I know it logical to follow the chain of
   implications based on one commit and see where else there might be
   gaps but... it is strange to just pickup someone else's work like
   that.

All just _seems_ weird and overdone. This isn't the kind of help I
need. That said, I _do_ appreciate you looking at making blk IO polling
work with bio-based (and DM's bio splitting in particular), but the
lack of importance you put on DM's splitting below makes me concerned.

DM targets themselves _do_ require their own splitting.  You cannot just
assume all IO that passes through DM targets doesn't need to be properly
sized on entry.  Sure underlying devices will do their own splitting,
but those splits are based on their requirements.  DM targets have their
own IO size limits too.  Each layer needs to enforce and respect the
constraints of its layer while also factoring in those of the underlying
devices.

Regression relative to what?  5.10 was the regression point.  The commit
header you pasted into your reply clearly conveys that commit
22ada802ede8 caused the regression.  It makes no sense to try to create
some other regression point.  You cannot have both from a single commit
in the most recent Linux 5.10 release.

And so I have no idea why you think that restoring DM's _required_
splitting constraints is somehow a regression.

No.  Not excessive splitting, required splitting.  And as I explained in
point 2) above, avoiding "excessive splits" isn't why lcm_not_zero() was
improperly used to stack chunk_sectors.

Some DM targets really do require the IO be split on specific boundaries
-- however inconvenient for the underlying layers that DM splitting
might be.

ti->max_io_len should always be set in the DM target's .ctr

DM core takes care of applying max_io_len to chunk_sectors since 5.10,
you should know that given your patch is meant to fix commit
882ec4e609c1

And for 5.11 I've staged a change to have it impose max_io_len in terms
of ->max_sectors too, see:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-5.11&id=41dcb8f21a86edbe409b2bef9bb1df4cb9d66858

One thing I clearly need to do moving forward is: always post my changes
to dm-devel; just so someone like yourself can follow along via email
client.  I just assumed others who care about DM changes also track the
linux-dm.git tree's branches.  Clearly not the best assumption or
practice on my part.

There is a very consistent and deliberate way that device limits must be
handled, sometimes I too have missteps but that doesn't change the fact
that there is a deliberate evenness to how limits are stacked.
blk_stack_limits() needs to be the authority on how these limits stack
up.  So all DM's limits stacking wraps calls to it.  My fix, shared in
point 1) above, restores that design pattern by _not_ having DM
duplicate a subset of how blk_stack_limits() does its stacking.
