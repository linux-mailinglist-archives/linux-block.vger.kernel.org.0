The complexity is understandable, though it can be viewed as a
capability as well. Note I do not have any desire to promote tcmu here,
just trying to understand if we need a brand new interface rather than
making the existing one better.

Well, for starters you gain the features and tools that are extensively
used with nvme. Plus you get the ecosystem support (development,
features, capabilities and testing). There are clear advantages of
plugging into an established ecosystem.

Again, if tcmu is not a good starting point (never ran it myself) we can
think of starting with a clean slate.

I largely agree with the feedback given on this attempt.
