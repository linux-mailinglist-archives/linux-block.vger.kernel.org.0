I'm not trying to make excuses. Should it have been compiled? Yes it
should. Did I miss it because it isn't part of my regular testing? Yes
obviously. Did I assume it was probably fine since multiple people
reviewed it, including the maintainer. Definitely. That doesn't excuse
the fact that it was missed, and it should not have been.

The tree is totally warning clean right now on build, but that's usually
not the case, and missing a single warning isn't that hard. It happens!
I think faulting someone severely for missing a mostly harmless warning
in a driver that can't be considered critical or tier 1 is a little out
there. That's all I'm trying to say.

And FWIW, this isn't some frivolous cleanup patch, it's fixing a real
error handling issue.

There are no new features in here! The only patch I'd argue you could
object to is the raw deprecation, which should have gone in for -rc1.
I'm happy to drop that, was only trying to make the deprecation period a
bit longer for it. The majority is pure fixes, and there are a few
cleanups in there that just seem silly to defer when they show up.
You're making this sound like it's some pile of garbage, and frankly I
think that's way out of line.

Right, and it totally shows since once the beaker flows over, then some
rando gets the wrath. Your delivery sucks, and you need to work on that.
This could have been handled so much better.

I'll rebase and re-test, but it'll be after -rc2.
