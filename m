And a specific bug I suppose :)

That makes more sense for me :) I'd like to help the testers to retry the
(randomly) failed cases, to help them to get their testing statistics. That's
better than recording these statistics in fstests itself.

After a "./check ..." done, generally fstests shows 3 list:
  Ran: ...
  Not run: ...
  Failures: ...

So you mean if the "--retry-failures N" is specified. we can have one more list
named "Flaky", which is part of "Failures" list, likes:
  Ran: ...
  Not run: ...
  Failures: generic/388 generic/475 xfs/104 xfs/442
  Flaky: generic/388 [2/N] xfs/104 [1/N]

If I understand this correctly, it's acceptable for me. And it might be helpful
for Amir's situation. But let's hear more voice from other developers, if there
is not big objection from other fs maintainers, let's do it :)

BTW, about the new group name to mark cases with random load/operations/env.,
what do you think? Any suggestions or good names for that?

Thanks,
Zorro
