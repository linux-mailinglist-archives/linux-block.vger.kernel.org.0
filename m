Please see the example in the following link:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20210421000235.2028-4-bvanassche@acm.org/T/#m4d7bc9aa01108f03d5b4b7ee102eb26eb0c778aa

In short:

1) One async completion from interrupt context is pending, and one request
isn't really freed yet because its driver tag isn't released.

2) Meantime iterating code still can visit this request, and ->fn() schedules
a new remote completion, and returns.

3) The scheduled async completion in 1) is really done now,
but the scheduled async completion in 2) isn't started or done yet

4) queue becomes frozen because of one pending elevator switching, so
sched request pool is freed since there isn't any pending iterator ->fn()

5) request UAF is caused when running the scheduled async completion in 2)
now.


Thanks,
Ming
