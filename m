OK, but both internal_get_user_pages_fast and ubd_release_pages still
takes 15%, and memcpy_erms() is 7.7%. But mm zero copy isn't ready,
so memcpy can't be avoided, also zero copy has other cost, which may
be big enough too.

One approach I thought of for reducing cost of pinning pages is to release
pages lazily, such as, release page when the request is idle for enough time,
meantime takes LRU way to free pages when number of total pinned pages are
beyond max allowed amount. IMO, this approach should get much improvement,
but it needs pre-allocation of userspace buffer, and the implementation
shouldn't be very hard.

The userspace buffer from app can be seen when UBD_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ
is sent to ubd driver.

Looks it is still not heavy enough, and we can use one per-queue/thread
bitmap to track IOs which need to be queued to ubd driver, and the
change should be easy.

You can export one helper of ubdsrv_complete_io() for target code

void ubdsrv_complete_io(struct ubdsrv_dev *dev,
        struct ubdsrv_queue *q, int tag, int res)
{
        struct ubd_io *io = &q->ios[tag];

        io->result = res;

        /* Mark this IO as free and ready for issuing to ubd driver */
        io->flags |= (UBDSRV_NEED_COMMIT_RQ_COMP | UBDSRV_IO_FREE);

        /* clear handling */
        io->flags &= ~UBDSRV_IO_HANDLING;
}

Then the target code calls ubdsrv_complete_io(), but you have to add new
approach to wakeup the ubdsrv pthread daemon which can wait in io_uring_enter().
That is why I still suggest to try to use io_uring for handling IO.

If you really have high performance requirement, and if cost of pining pages in
ubdsrv pthread daemon were saved, maybe you can run your app_write_req_handle()/
app_read_req_handle() in the ubdsrv pthread context directly if it is implemented
in AIO style.
