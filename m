Yes, that can happen. Here we compute just an upper bound on the number of
tags. Each entity can use less than this upper limit and thus there will be
tags left for entities in lower IO priority classes.

Sure, that can happen. bfqq_request_over_limit() gets called (as well as
scheduler tag allocation happens) at the moment process calls submit_bio().
Time when each process calls submit_bio() is completely out of our control.
It can even happen that BE process submits lots of IO, we let it allocate
lots of tags (because there isn't any other process in the service trees)
and then RT process submits its first IO - only at this moment tag limit
for BE process is reduced so BE process will block when trying to allocate
any further tag until it frees enough tags by completing IO. This is
actually the reason why we always allow a process to allocate at least some
tags so that it can enter service tree, then it can gradually allocate more
and more tags (because its tag allocation is not limited unlike the tag
allocation for BE process) until it uses appropriate share of tags.

Exactly.
