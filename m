That's what I figured, but it still does not provide semantics and works
just for specific cases.

Yes, it's doable. But it still is inconsistent behaviour. Assume the
following configuration:

  8 CPUs CPU0,1 assigned for housekeeping

With 8 queues the proposed change does nothing because each queue is
mapped to exactly one CPU.

With 4 queues you get the following:

 CPU0,1       queue 0
 CPU2,3       queue 1
 CPU4,5       queue 2
 CPU6,7       queue 3

No effect on the isolated CPUs either.

With 2 queues you get the following:

 CPU0,1,2,3   queue 0
 CPU4,5,6,7   queue 1

So here the isolated CPUs 2 and 3 get the isolation, but 4-7
not. That's perhaps intended, but definitely not documented.

So you really need to make your mind up and describe what the intended
effect of this is and why you think that the result is correct.

Thanks,
