Hmm. Not a fan of this approach.

Having to have a separate piece of code just to test individual 
functions, _and_ having to place hooks in the code to _simulate_ a 
failure seems rather fragile to me.

I would have vastly preferred if we could to this via generic tools like 
ebpf or livepatching.
Also I'm worried that this approach doesn't really scale; taken to 
extremes we would have to add duplicate calls to each and every function 
for full error injection, essentially double the size of the code just 
on the off-chance that someone wants to do error injection.

So I'd rather delegate the topic of error injection to a more general 
discussion (LSF springs to mind ...), and then agree on a framework 
which is suitable for every function.

Cheers,

Hannes
