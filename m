Using 'quirk' was my first idea in mind when we start to discuss the issue,=
 but
problem is that it isn't flexible, for example, one HBA may connects HDD. i=
n one
setting, and SSD. in another setting.

I don't understand the motivation of ramp-up/ramp-down, maybe it is just
for fairness among LUNs. So far, blk-mq provides fair IO submission
among LUNs. One problem of ignoring it is that sequential IO performance
may be dropped much compared with before.

The delay re-run can't work given we call blk_mq_get_dispatch_budget()
before dequeuing request from scheduler/sw queue for improving IO merge.
At that time, run queue won't be involved.
