This is one misuse of tag_list_lock, which is supposed to cover host
wide change, and shouldn't be used for request queue level protection,
which is exactly provided by q->sysfs_lock.

Not mention it will cause ABBA deadlock over freeze lock, please see
blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues(). And it can't be used for protecting
'nr_requests' too.

Same ABBA deadlock with above.
