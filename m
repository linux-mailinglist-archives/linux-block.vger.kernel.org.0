Yes, but we still can get requeue happening. Though for a SATA drive, that is
unlikely since the max queue depth is clearly defined, unlike for SAS drives

And that may be the issue. More on this below.

That would be way too much work on the user side, and likely open up a can of
device bugs unseen until now.

Passthrough commands do not go through the scheduler and are submitted directly
to the dispatch queue, generally at the head of it (see blk_mq_insert_request()).

So for a single queue device, even if ata_qc_defer causes a requeue, the
passthrough command ends up back at the top of the dispatch queue. After
repeating this a few times, all in-flight NCQ commands complete and the
passthrough command goes through.

But I feel this is very fragile given that the block layer requeue is done
through a work item, so in parallel to an application submitting IOs. So in
theory, I think that the requeue for the passthrough command could happen forever...

And for a multi-queue setup like with the hisi adapter, that is what is happening.

I do not have any good idea how to fix that yet. We need to find something.
scsi_queue_rq() and the budget/host or device blocked state management may help
with that, or we have a bug there... In any case, I do not think it is a block
layer issue as the block layer knows nothing about NCQ vs non-NCQ.
