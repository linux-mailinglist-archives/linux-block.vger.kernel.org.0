Don't do that.  Really.

First of all, your program might need to run on OS's other than Linux,
such as Legacy Unix systems, Mac OS X, etc, and officially, there is
zero guarantees about cache coherency between O_DIRECT writes and the
page cache.  So if you use O_DIRECT I/O and buffered I/O or mmap
access to a file.... all bet are off.

By definition O_DIRECT I/O bypasses the page cache, so if there is a
copy of the file's data block in the page cache, for some
implementations of some OS's the page cache might contain the previous
stale version of the block, so buffer reads might not have the updated
copy reflected by the O_DIRECT write.  And if the page is mmap'ed into
some process's address space, and the process dirties that page, that
page will get written back to the disk, potentially overwriting
O_DIRECT write.

Linux will make best efforts to maintain cache coherency between
O_DIRECT and the page cache.  It does that by writing out the page in
the page cache if it is dirty, and then evicting the the page from the
page cache.  In practice this will be good enough to keep programs
like a database which locks the database so it can take a consistent
snapshot, and then does the backup via buffered write, when the
database normally uses O_DIRECT for its transactions, it will work ---
since if the database wasn't locked while taking the backup, it would
be completely a mess, and the O_DIRECT vs page cache coherency is the
*least* of your worries.

But in general, don't mix bufered/mmap and O_DIRECT I/O to the same
file.  Just don't.  It might work, but remember that raison d'etre for
O_DIRECT is performance in support of databases and storage systems
where developers Know What They Are Doing(tm) and Follow The
Rules(tm).  Linux's cache coherency is best efforts only (and other
OS's might not even bother), and database developers and sysadmins
would be sad if we compromised O_DIRECT perforance just to make things
100% safe for people want to do things which are breaking the rules.

If you like breaking rules, don't use O_DIRECT.  You'll be happier for
it, as will hapless future users of your programs.  :-)

Remember, good programs are maintainable and portable.  What if some
one attempts to take your programs and tries to make it work on MacOS?

Cheers,
