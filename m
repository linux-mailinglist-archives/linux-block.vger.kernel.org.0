Hi Joanne,

this is about the 2 TB disk issue - 32 bit integer overflow on 
start_sect and nr_sects. The fix for that never went in.

Thanks for confirming everything in the RDB is meant to be big endian.

The other 'unsavoury' thing that worries us here is the fact that the 
number of heads and sectors (per cylinder) is defined in the partition 
block as well as in the RDB. We use the data from the partition block to 
calculate start sector and number of sectors for a partition, and my 
overflow checking path added a test that heads*sectors ==  
rdb_CylBlocks. I wonder how important that test is - do you know of any 
case where the head and sector numbers in RDB and partition blocks differ?

Thanks again,

     Michael
