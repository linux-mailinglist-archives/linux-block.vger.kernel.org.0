I guess we could do that as well. User side aio_reqprio field of struct aiocb,
which is used by io_uring and libaio, is an int, so 32-bits also. Changing
bi_ioprio to match that should not cause regressions or break user space I
think. Kernel uapi ioprio.h will need some massaging though.

Yeah, but if the kernel is compiled with struct randomization, that does not
really apply, doesn't it ?

Reading Niklas's reply to Kanchan, I was reminded that using ioprio hint for
the lifetime may have one drawback: that information will be propagated to the
device only for direct IOs, no ? For buffered IOs, the information will be
lost. The other potential disadvantage of the ioprio interface is that we
cannot define ioprio+hint per file (or per inode really), unlike the old
write_hint that you initially reintroduced. Are these points blockers for the
user API you were thinking of ? How do you envision the user specifying
lifetime ? Per file ? Or are you thinking of not relying on the user to specify
that but rather the FS (e.g. f2fs) deciding on its own ? If it is the latter, I
think ioprio+hint is fine (it is simple). But if it is the former, the ioprio
API may not be the best suited for the job at hand.
