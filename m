OK, I did see one boot crash issue on x86_64 with -next, so could
you share us that patch which needs to be reverted? Meantime, please
provide me your steps for reproducing this issue? (rootfs image, kernel
config, qemu command)

BTW, the patch has been tested in RH QE lab, so far not see such reports
yet.

Thanks,
