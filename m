If a read / write operations is happening on a sysfs file created by a
module, the module cannot be removed because it is the module's own
responsibility to remove the sysfs file on module exit. There is no
module lock. It is inferred.

Using an active reference.

Let me try to describe this again. Let's take it step by step, premise
by premise on the inference assumption. Let me know at which point you
disagree.

We are talking about sysfs files and you're argument is that
try_module_get() should lock the module, and so cannot be used
in sysfs files. My point is that such module lock is inferred:

1) Sysfs files are created by a module, that same module is responsible
   for removing the same sysfs files.
2) The module can only be removed and gone, once *all* sysfs files are
   removed first.
3) If any of the module's sysfs files are present the module must
   still be present
4) kernfs ensures that if a file is opened the file will not be
   removed until any pending operation completes
5) If a sysfs file is used to write something, that means the
   sysfs file has not yet been removed, and we know it will
   remain in existance throughout its entire operation
6) When a sysfs file operation is being run, the module must
   always exist
