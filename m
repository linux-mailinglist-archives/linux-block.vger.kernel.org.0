[ Upstream commit 94c43a13b8d6e3e0dd77b3536b5e04a84936b762 ]

During handshake, if we are diskless ourselves, we used to accept any size
presented by the peer.

Which could be zero if that peer was just brought up and connected
to us without having a disk attached first, in which case both
peers would just "flip" their volume sizes.

Now, even a diskless node will ignore "zero" sizes
presented by a diskless peer.

Also a currently Diskless Primary will refuse to shrink during handshake:
it may be frozen, and waiting for a "suitable" local disk or peer to
re-appear (on-no-data-accessible suspend-io). If the peer is smaller
than what we used to be, it is not suitable.

The logic for a diskless node during handshake is now supposed to be:
believe the peer, if
 - I don't have a current size myself
 - we agree on the size anyways
 - I do have a current size, am Secondary, and he has the only disk
 - I do have a current size, am Primary, and he has the only disk,
   which is larger than my current size
