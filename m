We have enabled it through uring to get async() passthru submission.
Looks like a hack at the moment, but we might just send a RFC to have
something concrete to based the discussion on.

Agree. This work depend in the application being aware of a max I/O size
at the moment. Down the road, we will remove (or at least limit a lot)
this constraint for ZNS devices that can eventually cache out-of-order
I/Os.

I am not familiar with SCSI SG. This looks like how the ioctl() passthru
works in NVMe, but as mentioned above, we would like to enable an
async() passthru path.
