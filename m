files, or more specifically file descriptors really are the wrong
analogy here.  A file descriptor allows you to keep writing to
a file that you were allowed to write to at open time.  And that's
fine (at least most of the time, people keep wanting a revoke and
keep implementing broken special cases of it, but I disgress).

The struct block_device is not such a handle, it's the underlying
object.  And the equivalent here is that we allow writes to inodes
that don't even implement a write method, or have the immutable
bit set.

Except the whole make a thing readonly just for fun is the corner case.
DM does it, and we have a sysfs file to allow it.  But the usual
case is that a block device has been read-only all the time, or has
been force to be read-only by the actual storage device, which
doesn't know anything about the file descriptor model, and will
not be happy.

So maybe a lazy read-only after the last writer goes away would be
nice (not that we actully track writers right now, but that whole
area is comletely fucked up and I'm looking into fixing it at the
moment).

And for extra fun blkdev_get_by_dev doesn't check for read-only
because we've historically allowed to open writable file descriptors
on read-only block devices for ioctls (in addition to the magic
(flags & O_ACCMODE) == 3 mode just ioctl).
