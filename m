I personally don't worry about whether my code is idiomatic. I just code
and when others give suggestions that sound good, I apply them. There is
nobody requiring all Rust code to be as idiomatic as possible. In the
review process you might be nudged to write in a more idiomatic style,
but that should also be true for C. The kernel is constantly adding new
ways of doing things and while the language itself doesn't evolve, the
codebase surely does.

For the private `validate_block_size` function, I can see your argument.
However, I don't think that the function will change any time soon, so I
don't think it's a huge issue.
