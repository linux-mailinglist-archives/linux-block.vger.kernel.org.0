As I said, if one write does not work, whatever the reason, all other writes
behind it for the same zone will also not work. So yes, handling of errors in
the end needs to be done after all writes come back to the issuer. Nothing new
here. I do not see the issue. And I am not sure where you want to go with this.

Yes. But I am still confused. Where is the problem ?
