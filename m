nvme_complete_request can not insulate against double completion.
Setting the state of request to MQ_RQ_COMPLETE avoid double completion.
tear down(nvme_cancel_request) check the state of the request, if the
state is MQ_RQ_COMPLETE, it will skip completion.

Currently, it is not safe for nvme. The probability is very low.
I am not sure whether similar occurs in other scenarios.
