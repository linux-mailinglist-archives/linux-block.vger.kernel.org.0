I understand the big point is that how to pass the io data to ubd driver's
request/bio pages. But splice/sendfile just transfers data between two FDs,
then how can the block request/bio's pages get filled with expected data?
Can you explain a bit in detail?

If block layer is bypassed, it won't be exposed as block disk to userspace.
