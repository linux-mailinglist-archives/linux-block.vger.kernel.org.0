I also have spent time to learn your codes, its idea is really good, thanks for this
great work. Though we're using tcmu, indeed we just needs a simple block device
based on block semantics. Tcmu is based on scsi protocol, which is somewhat
complicated and influences small io request performance. So if you like, we're
willing to participate this project, and may use it in our internal business, thanks.

Another little question, why you use raw io_uring interface rather than liburing?
Are there any special reasons?
