It sounds like the statistic is using the wrong criteria. It ought to
use the average time for the next available completion for any request
rather than the average latency of a specific IO. It might work at high
depth if the hybrid poll knew the hctx's depth when calculating the
sleep time, but that information doesn't appear to be readily available.
