s/to be online/to be offlined/ I guess.

Shouldn't all the per-cpu kthreads also stop as part of the offlining?
If they don't quiesce before the new blk-mq stop state I think we need
to make sure they do.  It is rather pointless to quiesce the requests
if a thread that can submit I/O is still live.

INACTIVE is set to the hctx, and it is set by the last CPU to be
offlined that is mapped to the hctx.  once the bit is set the barrier
ensured it is seen everywhere before we start waiting for the requests
to finish.  What is missing?:
