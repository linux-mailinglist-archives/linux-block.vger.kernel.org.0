Add one req flag REQ_TAG which will be used in the following patch for
supporting bio based IO polling.

Exactly this flag can help us to do:

1) request flag is cloned in bio_fast_clone(), so if we mark one FS bio
as REQ_TAG, all bios cloned from this FS bio will be marked as REQ_TAG.

2)create per-task io polling context if the bio based queue supports polling
and the submitted bio is HIPRI. This per-task io polling context will be
created during submit_bio() before marking this HIPRI bio as REQ_TAG. Then
we can avoid to create such io polling context if one cloned bio with REQ_TAG
is submitted from another kernel context.

3) for supporting bio based io polling, we need to poll IOs from all
underlying queues of bio device/driver, this way help us to recognize which
IOs need to polled in bio based style, which will be implemented in next
patch.
