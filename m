That's exactly what I'm doing. In fact I first renamed the variable
and am manually checking all places which do not compile anymore.
Hence the surprizes.

That's exactly what I'm doing.

OK this will help me, thanks for the hint :-)

Makes sense.

I like that. And at least we'll know how they use it (likely without the
dependency on fdc).
