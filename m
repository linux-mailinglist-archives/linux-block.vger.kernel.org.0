I am not talking about the parent blkg which can have a concurrent 
update. It is probably safe at the blkg level, but the lockless list may 
contain another bisc from a blkg that is not being destroyed.

That is true. Perhaps we can use Yosry's suggestion of adding a helper 
to acquire and release cgroup_rstat_lock before calling 
__blkcg_rstat_flush(). That will also guarantee no concurrent update.
