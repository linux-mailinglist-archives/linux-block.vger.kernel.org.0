Care to share how or at least point me in a direction please?

If I had a reliable way to trigger this it would help a great deal.  
Currently we're at 14 days uptime with scheduler set to none rather than 
mq-deadline, previously we had to hard reboot approximately every 7 days 
... again, how long is a piece of string?  A lockup proves the presence 
of an issue, but how long must it not lock up to prove the absence of?

Ideas/Suggestions?

Kind regards,
Jaco
