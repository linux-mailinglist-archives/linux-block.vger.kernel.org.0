I had a look into it now and I could do this but that would mean that
block_rq_merge trace event would now differ from all other similar events
and we couldn't use block_rq event class and have to define our own and so
overall it would IMO make future conversion to get rid of 'q' argument more
difficult, not simpler. So I can do this but are you really sure?
