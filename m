First inject request time out, crash happens due to request double
completion, the probability is very low. The reason: we will do error
recovery for request time out. When error recovery, new request will
be completed by nvmf_fail_nonready_command in queue_rq, the state of
the request will be changed to MQ_RQ_IN_FLIGHT, the request is freed
asynchronously in nvme_submit_user_cmd, nvme_submit_user_cmd may
run after cancel request(the state of the request is MQ_RQ_IN_FLIGHT)
in error recovery. The request will be double completion.

Second use two HBAs for nvme native multipath, and then inject one HBA
fault, io error happens and a low probability crash happens. The reason
of io error is the blk_status_t of queue_rq is BLK_STS_IOERR, blk-mq
call blk_mq_end_request to complete the request. We expect the request
fail over to normal HBA, but the request is directly completed with
BLK_STS_IOERR. The reason of crash is similar to the first scenario.
