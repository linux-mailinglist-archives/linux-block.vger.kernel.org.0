So I'm a little worried about the "support for multipath will follow" as
this has implications for the naming scheme, and our policy of how we
allow access to a namespace.

Ignoring some of the deprecated historic mistakes I think the policy
should be:

 - admin commands that often are controller specific should usually
   go to a controller-specific device, the existing /dev/nvmeX
   devices
 - I/O commands and admin command that do specific a nsid should go
   through a per-namespace node that is multipath aware and not
   controller specific

Which also makes me wonder about patch 2 in the series that seems
somewhat dangerous.   Can we clearly state the policy implemented?
