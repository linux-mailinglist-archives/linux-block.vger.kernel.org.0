Hi Jianchao,

Our conclusion from the extensive measurements we ran is that we cannot
reach our latency goals for high-priority I/O without I/O priority
support in the storage device. This is why we are working with device
vendors on implementing I/O priority support in the storage devices that
matter to us.

Thanks,

Bart.
