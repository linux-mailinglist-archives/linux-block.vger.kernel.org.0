Ming's first patch:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/dm-devel/patch/20211221141459.1368176-2-ming.lei@redhat.com/
is pure cleanup for the mess that went in this merge cycle.

All that dm-rq context aside, Ming's 1st patch is the correct way to
clean up the block core flags/state (internal vs external, etc).

But the 2nd paragraph of that first patch's header should be moved to
Ming's 2nd patch because it explains why DM needs the new
blk_alloc_disk_srcu() interface, e.g.:
"But dm queue is allocated before tagset is allocated"
(so it confirms it best to explain that in 2nd patch).

But really even Ming's 2nd patch:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/dm-devel/patch/20211221141459.1368176-3-ming.lei@redhat.com/
should _not_ need to be debated like this.

Fact is alloc_disk() has always mirrored blk_alloc_queue()'s args.  So
Ming's 2nd patch should be done anyway to expose meaningful control
over request_queue allocation.  If anything, the 2nd patch should just
add the 'alloc_srcu' arg to blk_alloc_disk() and change all but NVMe
callers to pass false.

Put another way: when the 'node_id' arg was added to blk_alloc_queue()
a new blk_alloc_disk_numa_node() wasn't added (despite most block
drivers still only using NUMA_NO_NODE).  This new 'alloc_srcu' flag is
seen to be more niche, but it really should be no different on an
interface symmetry and design level.

Patch 3 can be left out if you'd like to force your world view on
everyone... you've already "won", _pretty please_ stop being so
punitive by blocking reasonable change.  We really can get along if
we're all willing to be intellectually honest.

To restate: Ming's patches 1 and 2 really are not "cruft".  They
expose control over request_queue allocation that should be accessible
by both blk_alloc_queue() and blk_alloc_disk().
