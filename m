Follows the point:

1) for blk-mq, we hold one refcount for bio and another for request, and
release one after ending bio or completing request.

2) for bio based queue, just holding one refcount for bio, and release it
after the bio is ended.

As I mentioned to you, the current in-tree code only grabs the refcount
during submitting bio for bio base queue, and the refcount is released
after returning from submission, see __submit_bio().

It can be either one after bio based io polling is supported,
queue/io_poll is exposed for both blk-mq and bio based queue.

However, I guess bio based polling doesn't need such strict bio queue
freezing, cause QUEUE_FLAG_POLL is only read in submission path, so
looks current freezing just during submission is enough.
