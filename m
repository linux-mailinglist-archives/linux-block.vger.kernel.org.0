BTW, Yanhui reported that sequential write on virtio-scsi drops by
40~70% in VM, and the virito-scsi is backed by file image on XFS over
megaraid_sas. And the disk is actually SSD, instead of HDD. It could
be worse in case of megaraid_sas HDD.

Same drop is observed on virtio-blk too.

I didn't figure out one simple reproducer in host side yet, but the
performance data is pretty stable in the VM IO workload.


Thanks, 
Ming
