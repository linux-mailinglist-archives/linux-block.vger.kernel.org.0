I have thought about that too. However, in my test, just calling 
cgroup_rstat_flush() in blkcg_destroy_blkgs() did not prevent dying 
blkcgs from increasing meaning that there are still some extra 
references blocking its removal. I haven't figured out exactly why that 
is the case. There may still be some races that we have not fully 
understood yet. On the other hand, Ming's patch is verified to not do 
that since it does not take extra blkg references. So I am leaning on 
his patch now. I just have to make sure that there is no concurrent 
rstat update.

Cheers,
Longman
