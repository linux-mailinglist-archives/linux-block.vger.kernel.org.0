Hi Bob.
Thank you for your message.

I looked at your patch - it's interesting, but I have a few comments.

1.
#ifdef CONFIG_BPF_IO_FILTER
	struct bpf_prog_array __rcu *progs;
	struct mutex io_filter_lock;
#endif
For DM and blk-snap to work, it is necessary that there is always
the possibility of interception.

2.
We could get rid of the io_filter_lock lock if we do attach/detach while
the queue is stopped. And __rcu for *progs, can not use either.

3.
int io_filter_bpf_run(struct bio *bio)
{
	struct bpf_io_request io_req = {
		.sector_start = bio->bi_iter.bi_sector,
		.sector_cnt = bio_sectors(bio),
		.opf = bio->bi_opf,
	};
	return BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY_CHECK(bio->bi_disk->progs, &io_req, BPF_PROG_RUN);
}
Allows to get little information. It will not allow to work with the bios`s data.
blk_interposer allows to get full access to bio.
For use in the DM, we must also be able to add new bio's.

Summary:
For device-mapper purposes, bpf_io_filter is not suitable.
bpf_io_filter in this form is probably convenient to use for monitoring and
studying the block layer.
For the security task, I would suggest making a separate module and using
blk_interposer to intercept bio requests. This will give more flexible
functionality and better performance.
