What is broken in START_DEV/STOP_DEV?  Please explain the semantics you
want and what doesn't work.  FYI, there is nothing in the test suite the
complains.  And besides the obvious block layer bug that Jens found you
seemed to be perfectly happy with the semantics.

SCSI needs it because it needs the request_queue to probe for what ULP
to bind to, and it allows to unbind the ULP.  None of that is the case
here.  And managing the lifetimes separately is a complete mess, so
don't do it.  Especially not in a virtual driver where you don't have
to cater to a long set protocol like SCSI.
