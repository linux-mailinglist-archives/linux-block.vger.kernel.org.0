When delete partition executes concurrently with IOs issue,
it may cause use-after-free on part in disk_map_sector_rcu()
as following:

blk_account_io_start(req1)  delete_partition  blk_account_io_start(req2)

rcu_read_lock()
disk_map_sector_rcu
part = rcu_dereference(ptbl->part[4])
                           rcu_assign_pointer(ptbl->part[4], NULL);
                           rcu_assign_pointer(ptbl->last_lookup, NULL);
rcu_assign_pointer(ptbl->last_lookup, part);

                           hd_struct_kill(part)
!hd_struct_try_get
  part = &rq->rq_disk->part0;
rcu_read_unlock()
                           __delete_partition
                           call_rcu
                                            rcu_read_lock
                                            disk_map_sector_rcu
                                            part = rcu_dereference(ptbl->last_lookup);

                           delete_partition_work_fn
                           free(part)
                                            hd_struct_try_get(part)
                                            BUG_ON use-after-free

req1 try to get 'ptbl->part[4]', while the part is beening
deleted. Although the delete_partition() try to set last_lookup
as NULL, req1 can overwrite it as 'part[4]' again.

After calling call_rcu() and free() for the part, req2 can
get the part by last_lookup, resulting in use after free.

In fact, this bug has been reported by syzbot:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/1/4/357

We fix the bug by rereading ptbl->part[i] after setting
last_lookup. If part[i] is NULL, that means the part will
be freed, we need to clear last_lookup.

Then we can make sure last_lookup have been set as NULL
before call_rcu(). Thus, others can not get the freed part.
