Yes, but it also has:

       If no I/O scheduler has been set for a thread, then by default the  I/O
       priority  will  follow  the  CPU nice value (setpriority(2)).  In Linux
       kernels before version 2.6.24, once an I/O priority had been set  using
       ioprio_set(),  there was no way to reset the I/O scheduling behavior to
       the default.  Since Linux 2.6.24, specifying ioprio as 0 can be used to
       reset to the default I/O scheduling behavior.

So apparently even the manpage itself is inconsistent ;) (and I will
neglect the mistake that the text says "no I/O scheduler" instead of "no
I/O priority"). And there is actually code in BFQ (and there used to be
code in CFQ) that does:
        switch (ioprio_class) {
	...
        case IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE:
                /*
                 * No prio set, inherit CPU scheduling settings.
                 */
                bfqq->new_ioprio = task_nice_ioprio(tsk);
                bfqq->new_ioprio_class = task_nice_ioclass(tsk);
                break;
	
So IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE indeed has a meaning and it used to be the default
one until Christoph's 5a9d041ba2f6 in most cases. Your change e70344c05995
happening before that actually didn't change much practically because IO
contexts were initialized with 0 priority anyway and that was what
get_current_ioprio() was returning.

So I agree we should settle on how to treat IOs with unset IO priority. The
behavior to use task's CPU priority when IO priority is unset is there for
a *long* time and so I think we should preserve that. The question is where
in the stack should the switch from "unset" value to "effective ioprio"
happen. Switching in IO context is IMO too early since userspace needs to
be able to differentiate "unset" from "set to
IOPRIO_CLASS_BE,IOPRIO_BE_NORM". But we could have a helper like
current_effective_ioprio() that will do the magic with mangling unset IO
priority based on task's CPU priority.

The fact is that bio->bi_ioprio gets set to anything only for direct IO in
iomap_dio_rw(). The rest of the IO has priority unset (BFQ fetches the
priority from task's IO context and ignores priority on bios BTW). And the
only place where req->ioprio (inherited from bio->bi_ioprio) gets used is
in a few drivers to set HIGHPRI flag for IOPRIO_CLASS_RT IO and then the
relatively new code in mq-deadline.

So it all is very inconsistent mess :-|

Yes, I think that would make sence although as I explain above this is
somewhat independent to what the default IO priority behavior should be.
