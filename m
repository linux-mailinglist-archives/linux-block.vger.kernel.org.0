The splat itself can be avoided easily by replace wait_event with
wait_event_timeout() plus loop, but I guess you think the sync delete
isn't good too?

It is designed in this way from beginning, and I believe it is just for
the sake of simplicity, and one point is that the device number needs
to be freed after 'ublk del' returns.

But if it isn't friendly from user's viewpoint, we can change to return
-EBUSY. One simple solution is to check if the ublk block device
is opened before running any deletion action, if yes, stop to delete it
and return -EBUSY; otherwise go ahead and stop & delete the pair of devices.
And the userspace part(ublk utility) needs update too.

However, -EBUSY isn't perfect too, cause user has to retry the delete
command manually.

thanks,
Ming
