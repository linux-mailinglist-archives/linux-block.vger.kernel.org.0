Yes, this could work.  It'll get worse with anything we need to do under
q_usage_counter counter, though.  I mean, it is a perpcu_counter, which
should be really light-weight compared to all the other stuff you do.
I'd really love to see numbers that show it matters.

Well, we don't really prevent any setting from changing at runtime.
But yes, neither mmc nor the few scsi drivers using it seems to do
any runtime re-configuration.

I wish we could see some more folks from the mmc maintainers to do
proper scatterlist (or bio/request) kmap helpers.  The scsi drivers
could easily piggy back on that or just be disabled for HIGHMEM configs.
