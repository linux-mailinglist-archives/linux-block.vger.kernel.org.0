That's what I thought - mind you, rdb_CylBlocks is not declared little 
endian, just __u32 which can be either.

The reason why only rdb_SummedLongs, rdb_BlockBytes and 
rdb_PartitionList are explicitly declared big endian is probably quite 
simple - nothing else was used by the Linux RDB parser. My patch adds 
rdb_CylBlocks to that list, so that ought to be changed to big endian, too.

affs_hardblocks.h is a UAPI header - what are the rules and 
ramifications around changes to those? Might not be worth the hassle in 
the end.

Correct - in order to use RDB partitions on little endian systems, all 
of the data used by the Linux kernel must be converted to host byte 
order before using them in calculations.

Let's do that then. Unless someone feels strongly otherwise, I'll drop 
the rdb_CylBlocks check.
