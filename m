scsi disk may be released before calling blk_cleanup_queue(), and we
want to tear down all FS related stuff(cgroup, rqos, elevator) in disk_release().

And FS bios have been drained already when releasing disk.

When removing a request queue, the associated disk has been removed
already, and queue's kobject has been deleted too, so how can userspace
unload I/O scheduler at that time?

Yeah, bios have been done, but request is done after bio is ended, see
blk_update_request(), that is why we added blk_mq_freeze_queue() here.

disk may be released before calling blk_cleanup_queue().

But I admit here the name of blk_mq_release_queue() is very misleading,
maybe blk_mq_release_io_queue() is better?
