The way how memory limit currently is implemented in tcmu really looks
not very sophisticated. It waits until the hard limit is reached and
then frees as much memory as possible. Ideas for a better algorithm are
welcome!

Currently, I think the best way to limit mem usage in existing tcmu
is to limit data area size per tcmu device. The default of 1 GB per dev
I think is rarely needed. So users should configure devices carefully.
OTOH, if many tcmu devs are in use, even with small data areas the total
limit of 2GB can easily be reached. E.g., I know of a customer who uses
256 tcmu devs with 16MB each. So he rises the global limit to even 4GB,
as from performance point of view every releasing of data pages with
later re-allocation is just an overhead.

 From this point of view I think it would be difficult to find a good
algorithm.

TCM core can send multiple new cmds to tcmu concurrently, but cmdr_lock
forces sequential processing. So, some time ago I started an attempt to
make tcmu release the cmdr_lock while it copies sgl_pages. The measured
results unfortunately were not as good as expected. But I still need to
do further meassurements to find and possibly fix the reason.

With that change, I hope to also lower the latency by far for cmds
with big data transfers.

I'm still not convinced that you can get the support from mm you need.

BTW: after the cmdr_lock changes I described, the next step from my side
would be to avoid data copy in an even more efficient way for at least
those fabrics, that use core sgl allocation by calling
transport_generic_new_command or transport_handle_cdb_direct, or
target_submit_prep without pre-allocated sgls. The idea is to add a new
optional backend call that allows the backend (tcmu) to build sgls from
its own pages (tcmu: data pages). This method avoid data copy _and_
the need for mapping/unmapping sgl pages because we use already mapped
pages.

Of cause, this method does not speed up loopback, vhost and some other
fabrics, but it works very well e.g. for qla2xxx.
